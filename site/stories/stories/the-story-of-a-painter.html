He tried to draw on the pavement with pieces of brick, but janitors and patrolmen didn’t appreciate such art. He would have painted on walls or on fences, but every wall and fence belonged to someone. Besides, brick doesn’t really draw on walls; it only scratches.<br><br>At least the painter had a roof over his head—sort of. The janitor in the apartment building where the painter had once owned a unit partitioned off the dark corner under the stairs, where he kept his brooms, shovels, and work clothes, and advertised the makeshift cupboard as a “Private Apartment for Rent—No Running Water.” This was where our painter slept: on the floor, with his coat for a blanket, happy nevertheless that he wasn’t sleeping in the street.<br><br>How the painter had come to rent this closet is a long story. We’ll just say that he was one of the many gullible souls who were promised a fortune for their little apartments, their only property, and who woke up the next morning on a bench in a park, trying to remember what had happened and why their apartments were sporting new locks and curtains.<br><br>As for the corner under the stairs, the painter lived there on credit. The janitor hoped that someday the painter would win the lawsuit he had filed against Adik, the crook who had swindled him out of his apartment, and would then pay what he owed. As the painter’s back rent accumulated, however, the janitor felt more and more aggravated at the sight of his prone body when he came in early in the morning to get his shovel or his broom. Loud scenes began to take place. The janitor screamed that in the whole universe there was only one kindhearted fool who would give away valuable housing and tolerate not being paid for six months. “You owe me a cool million, you hear!” the janitor yelled, brandishing his broom, while the painter pulled his coat over his ears. “Pay up or get lost! There’s a line waiting!” He ruminated: “Or I could rent *you* out, instead. I could post an ad—‘Slave for Rent, Three Years’ Payment Required.’ But an ad costs money and time. That’s it. Go to the hospital and sell a kidney—you got two, one too many for one person.” The janitor carried on like that every morning, like a rooster; thankfully, unlike a rooster, he had two days off every week, and that was when his poor tenant could get some sleep.<br><br>On weekdays, the painter crawled out of his hole at seven sharp and began his daily journey through the city streets. He also hung around the dumpster in the building’s courtyard, in the hope that Adik would throw out his old canvases, brushes, and paints, which were still in the apartment. Then he’d be able to paint a picture and sell it!<br><br>But when things are bad they only get worse. One day, on arriving “home,” the painter discovered five dogs, a grand piano, a young woman, and her parents moving into his old apartment. One of the dogs was blind, but it cheerfully participated in the collective barking, while piles of books and sheet music, shelves, chairs, and a cage with a cat were carried through the front doors.<br><br>The painter fell in love with that odd family then and there, especially with the blind dog and the daughter, who seemed so mature, though she was only a girl—and he hung his head and walked away. Never would he testify in court against these people, demanding their eviction. The swindler Adik knew exactly what he was doing, reselling the painter’s apartment to this family.<br><br>The next morning, the crestfallen painter set off to paint his paintings. He did paint, after all, if only with his eyes. Like a battle commander, he’d look for the most advantageous position, then take account of the landscape: a squat old building; a small church under a silver dome; a feathery cloud; a budding tree; a plump customer leaving the bakery with a baguette—stay, moment, you are beautiful! In his imaginary painting, the colors shone and sparkled; the sky was turquoise; the fresh bread and the walls of the church gave off a golden glow; the customer’s baggy dress flowered like a lilac bush; and the final touch was an old hag in an orange flannel housedress, shuffling toward the bakery.<br><br>On finishing this masterpiece, the painter took a deep breath. His hands were twitching and his eyes glistened with happy tears. If the world could see his painting, it would laugh with delight, he thought. Then he crossed the street dreamily to the bakery and spent some time breathing in the aroma of fresh baguettes, the rich, filling smell of country loaves, and the light fragrance of warm rolls. It never occurred to him to beg; he didn’t look for crumbs on the floor but simply stood there with his eyes closed, enjoying the warmth.<br><br>Next, he’d visit his hiding place under the porch of a neighboring building, where he kept shards of limestone, brick, and coal. From there, he searched for an empty spot of pavement, usually finding one in the remotest corner of the park, and crawled on his hands and knees until dark, painting: a gray sparrow, a white cat, a brick-red poppy growing right through the pavement.<br><br>That day, the painter drew a group of five dogs beside a cage with a cat, a grand piano viewed from above, and a stern young lady. Sometimes sympathetic passersby gave him money, and this was what he lived on. Today, his painting attracted a small crowd: children with ice cream, their grandmothers loaded with extra clothes and snacks, retirees in neatly pressed clothing, and some unshaven individuals with traces of anguish on their faces and completely empty hands. Those people never gave him anything; for that, there were middle-aged women, capable of breaking into tears at the sight of an obviously single, skinny, uncared-for man.<br><br>The general public didn’t always approve of the painter’s creations. Some weren’t pleased that he used only three colors. They could do it better, they said. But the children liked his art, for the most part—it inspired them to their own acts of creation, except that they wanted to create not on empty pavement but directly on the painter’s work. The smallest ones showered it with sand and dirt and then sprinkled it with rainwater. The resulting swamp was marked with little footprints. The painter didn’t complain; he understood that this, too, was art. But the grandmothers did object. They sprang from their benches, grabbed their charges, and dragged them away, loudly lamenting wet feet, a potential cold, and ruined pants. The kids disappeared, and the painter was left alone in a dirt patch, thinking that a painting made with soil, water, and tiny footprints also deserved to be in some museum—whether of geology or of postmodern art.<br><br>Today, the children decorated his dogs with glasses and horns, watered the poppy until it melted, then performed a tap dance in muddy sneakers on the grand piano. No one offered him any money. But then fate smiled on him. A passerby approached, extremely rotund, clad in a leather jacket, and with very dirty hands. He was chewing gum, which he spat out, with great precision, right onto a bearded and bespectacled dog.<br><br>“Do you have a room to let for the night?” he asked. “I’ll pay you. A lot.”<br><br>“Money in advance,” the hungry painter said. He figured that since it was Saturday and the janitor wasn’t coming in the morning, for one night he’d manage somehow. The man handed over a wad of small bills and demanded to be taken to his bed at once. On reaching the cupboard under the stairs, the man accepted the key, closed the door, collapsed on the floor, and grew quiet. Soon, the painter heard a long whistle, followed by a choking sound, then a mournful sigh. The painter thought that his tenant had suffocated without fresh air and tried to force the door open, but the man’s prone body filled the entire space and the door wouldn’t budge. He thought about taking the door off its hinges, but then the whistling, the choking, and the moaning were repeated again and again, and the painter realized that the tenant had simply fallen asleep.<br><br>The painter left him to it. At the bakery, he bought a loaf of cheap bread, a couple of rolls, and a bottle of soda. With a full belly, he roamed the city all day, and in the evening returned to his cupboard. His attempts to open the door failed. A loud argument was taking place inside and the arguers didn’t even notice the knocking.<br><br>At nightfall, the door opened once, to admit a large woman, with two enormous plastic sacks. The painter tried to squeeze in after her, but numerous hands and feet pushed him out. He got the impression that the cupboard contained at least five people, stacked on sacks and bags up to the ceiling.<br><br>The painter lay down outside his door, trembling with cold and misery. Inside, two people were snoring, another two were arguing, and a baby was crying—it must have just been born.<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65148a032b339a0cd626]<br><br>In the morning, three more female relatives loaded with sacks moved in—they simply stepped over the poor painter and disappeared inside. Immediately, the vestibule filled with aromas of bread and garlic bologna. The painter knocked and asked for more money, but received an answer in the form of a huge fist. The fist waved at him blindly, and finally the painter grasped the hopelessness of his situation. The message was reinforced by the arrival of new guests, who filled the whole lobby with sacks and mattresses. Children gently frisked the painter’s pockets; somebody was tugging on his coat. The former cupboard occupant barely managed to pull himself free and run away.<br><br>There he was. The day’s program, it seemed, was the same as always. First, imaginary painting, then imaginary breakfast and so on—the happy life of a pauper, except that this pauper, exhausted and downhearted after a sleepless night, couldn’t feel much happiness and scolded himself for being a gullible sap who had lost everything twice.<br><br>A light drizzle had enveloped the city in a lilac fog and split the colors into little rainbows, so that distant objects now seemed mysterious and magical. He used to love painting such cityscapes: it was enough to drench a sheet of watercolor paper in a puddle, then with one wide stroke create a golden sky over gray vistas, drop in multicolored cubes of houses, and in the foreground a car of an emerald hue that doesn’t exist in nature and the reflection of that chemically pure color in a rippled puddle. But now the hungry, wet, homeless painter was dragging himself along the streets, ignoring the foggy air and the damp iridescent walls. With no shelter to his name, he couldn’t entertain the beautiful dreams that used to sustain him: couldn’t envision himself winning the case against Adik or selling paintings to the world’s museums.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He could no longer pretend that his life wasn’t a total failure and that nothing except art concerned him.<br><br>He stumbled on, resting briefly on doorsteps, sneaking into stores for a little warmth, and, finally, when his strength was at an end, when he was ready to lie down and die, instinct told him to return to his old building. He lay down outside his former apartment door and dozed off. He woke up in the morning, when the dogs started barking inside the apartment and the delicious smell of fresh coffee filled the stairwell. Someone was playing beautifully on the grand piano. Ungluing his eyelids, the painter saw next to him a jar of hot coffee and a brown bag full of fried potatoes, a hot dog, a plastic fork, and a huge slice of bread.<br><br>Oh, how long and joyfully the poor wretch relished these gifts! How he wept, squatting against the wall, over his ruined life! How he promised himself that he would overcome everything and see that wonderful family one more time and give them his painting, the one he had drawn on the pavement, a collaboration with all the kids in the park!<br><br>As soon as our homeless hero had finished his breakfast, the lock creaked. The painter quickly grabbed the bag and rushed down the steps to avoid seeing the kindly tenants. He felt embarrassed by their charity.<br><br>At nightfall, after roaming the streets all day, the frozen pauper perched under an awning. It was still raining; there was nowhere to go. He would never return to his old door, where the dogs were barking and the piano was playing. And there was no point in going to the closet: the new tenants would simply rob him of his coat, his last possession.<br><br>He was sitting with his eyes closed, expecting to be kicked out from under the awning at any moment; after all, every roof belonged to someone. Indeed, he soon received a tap on the shoulder. The pauper opened his eyes and saw a strange man, fat and gleeful. He introduced himself as an old friend from art college, who had given up painting after becoming rich. The painter didn’t recognize him, but the man remembered his name. “Igor!” he said. “You want my old equipment? I forgot how to paint—and I don’t want to ruin my new duds. You look like you could use some material support.”<br><br>“Equipment? Paints and brushes?”<br><br>“Sure, Igor. And everything else.”<br><br>“Canvases, too?”<br><br>“Of course. And much, much more! Now come along.”<br><br>The painter was glad that somebody was inviting him somewhere. Who knows, it might be warm and dry there, and the forgotten classmate might give him something to eat and even offer shelter for the night. What can he take from me? the painter thought miserably. But then he suddenly felt ashamed for agreeing to go with the first stranger who asked him, and he replied uncertainly, “I don’t know, really. I’m in a bit of a hurry.”<br><br>“Where can you be hurrying to?” the old classmate roared indignantly. He even performed an indignant jig. “You have nowhere to go! Don’t you remember me? I’m Izvosia! I used to take your lunch money at school!” The painter immediately remembered this Izvosia, a rare scoundrel, who was two years older than him and had always taken his money, his erasers, and his crayons.<br><br>“That’s right: nowhere. I stopped by your old place, looking for you. Adik has cheated your gullible ass, hasn’t he? And under the stairs, in your closet, it’s packed.” It was a cold, damp evening, which probably explained the curls of steam coming from Izvosia’s mouth.<br><br>“Sorry. I’m in a hurry,” the painter whispered.<br><br>Izvosia’s face seemed to be melting in the fog. Here we go, the painter thought. I must be losing my mind from hunger.<br><br>“Sure, go ahead and stay here,” Izvosia shouted at him, as though from a distance. “Everyone digs his own grave!” And he disappeared in the darkening twilight.<br><br>I’m definitely losing my mind, the painter decided. He stood up and took a good look at the building behind him. Its windows and doors were gone; in the lobby, a small tree was growing through a crack in the crumbled floor. The poor painter found a shabby couch in a corner, collapsed on it, and for the first time in a long while fell asleep on a soft surface.<br><br>In the morning, his slumber was disrupted by a tremendous noise. Bulldozers were roaring outside, preparing to crush the building. The roof fell in just as the painter dashed out the door. He shivered from the morning cold and started to walk away, but he was stopped by one of the bulldozer operators, who asked him hurriedly, “Excuse me, is this yours?,” and showed him a blank stretched canvas. “This was in the building, in your room.” The painter shrugged and replied honestly, “No, it isn’t mine, and the room wasn’t mine, either,” and kept on walking. But he couldn’t help himself. He turned around. He saw a lonely white canvas and a folded easel leaning against the concrete wall, which was about to be knocked down. Before he lost his nerve, he dashed back and collected those treasures. He remembered being hungry every day during his school years because of that scoundrel Izvosia, and had vowed never to take another person’s property, but in this case he was saving the items from imminent destruction. Dragging the heavy easel, with the canvas under his arm, he decided to look for a lost-and-found.<br><br>But, before he had gone far, a cheerful crone crossed his path. The painter asked her if she knew who used to live in the demolished house. “A painter did,” she informed him readily. “He had a contract to paint his old classmate’s portrait and was almost done, but suddenly died. There were no heirs. Oh dear, what mayhem followed. The gangsters drove up in their tanks, posted guards, grabbed everything. The poor folks got nothing, as usual.”<br><br>“Take this, then.” The painter offered her his treasures.<br><br>“Nah,” the crone scoffed. “I picked up plenty of junk there: brushes, paints, two rolls of canvas. At the market, no one would give me a penny for them. So I just tossed everything. Painters don’t use brushes these days. They use sprays of some kind. And some, I’ve heard, give themselves enemas with paint and then poop directly on the canvas. Can you believe it?”<br><br>The strangely well-informed crone was dancing a kind of jig, like Izvosia, and quickly disappeared around the corner.<br><br>Right away, the painter raced to his favorite spot, across from the bakery. Golden baguettes floated in people’s arms and grocery bags; the rain had stopped, and the turquoise sky was bright; the pink and yellow buildings were crowding one another, around the little church on the narrow street; and an ancient hag in an orange housedress was limping toward the bakery.<br><br>The painter set up his easel and proceeded to work so fast that his movements were blurred. The brushes were dancing in his hands, and very soon the canvas began to shine and glitter. Passersby stopped in amazement, offering friendly comments: “The sky is wrong,” “The bread is wrong,” and so on. The painter had heard such comments before and ignored them. The swindler Adik, incidentally, had acted differently when they first met. He had approached the painter and praised immoderately a barely started sketch. Naturally, the painter had felt flattered that a sensitive judge of his talent had finally come along, and he had invited Adik to his home to look at other paintings. Full of compliments, Adik had offered to help such a gifted painter sell his apartment at a profit and buy a cheaper one. The same day, he’d given Adik the power of attorney for all his property. We know how that ended.<br><br>He soon finished the painting. Suddenly, it occurred to him to check in with his lawyer regarding his lawsuit against Adik. He headed in that direction, carrying the painting with him, and after a few paces looked back, to say goodbye to his beloved spot. But somehow the spot had disappeared. A cloud of thick fog had descended on the intersection and made it invisible. Funny how quickly the weather changes, the painter thought absent-mindedly, and kept walking.<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65075d2f45736c34ceaa]<br><br>To his surprise, the lawyer was at his desk and greeted him with incredible news. “Your case has been won and the swindler Adik will be kicked out of your apartment today. You owe me ten per cent of its value. Go there right now. Don’t drag it out. With each day, your debt will grow.”<br><br>The painter started off toward home, then stopped in his tracks. It was not Adik who would be evicted that day. It was that family, the girl and her parents, their five dogs and their cat. The painter raced back to the lawyer’s office, but the lawyer had left. Office hours were over.<br><br>The bedlam that met him at his building was heartbreaking. Upstairs, the dogs were barking; the door to the apartment was wide open and he could see the tenants packing. The painter found the girl trying to shove the cat into its cage. “Look,” he told her, “you don’t have to leave. You can stay!”<br><br>“What do you mean, exactly?”<br><br>“I mean that I’m the rightful owner of this apartment, but you can continue to live here.”<br><br>“I see,” the girl said indifferently. “So you are the man who robbed my poor Adik? Took away all his property, sent him to jail, and then took pity on him and gave him back one of his apartments? That’s you?”<br><br>“Adik is a crook!” the confused painter exclaimed.<br><br>“Adik is not a crook,” the girl announced coldly, having finally stuffed the cat into its cage. “Adik is my husband.” She said it without bitterness or pride, but with a certain force, as though the fact of her marriage were being disputed.<br><br>The girl carried the cat outside and it became clear that she was limping.<br><br>“Let me help you,” the painter offered. “Your leg is hurting.”<br><br>“My leg doesn’t hurt at all.”<br><br>“But it does—I can see,” the painter said, really upset now.<br><br>“No, it doesn’t!” And, trying not to limp, the girl carried the cage downstairs.<br><br>The movers, in the meantime, had their ropes around the grand piano and were dragging it out. The painter decided to at least help the family pack, and was tying up some books when the girl’s father walked in and said something to the movers. They left immediately, abandoning the grand piano, the bookshelves, and the table in the middle of the room.<br><br>Outside, the moving truck rolled away. Through the window, the painter could see the entire family sitting on their suitcases. The cat’s cage was on the girl’s lap; the dogs surrounded her like a fan. The family was probably waiting for Adik, who just as probably wasn’t coming. The painter watched the girl unpack the animals’ bowls, pour food into them, and let the cat out of its cage.<br><br>The spring was terrible that year. It rained often, and now the city was covered with fat, dark clouds about to burst. But the painter was afraid to go down and offer his help. He was afraid even to show his face in the window. That was how guilty he felt, but his hands were tied. Adik must have robbed and then abandoned his wife. He’d probably sold her apartment with a promise to find her something better and, for the time being, moved her into the painter’s little place. And yet his poor wife didn’t want to hear a single word against her Adonis. The painter was reflecting in this vein when he suddenly heard Adik’s voice behind him.<br><br>“I’m taking the keys,” Adik announced, “because I’ve appealed to the higher court, and in the meantime this is my apartment. I have the paperwork proving that you owe me a large amount, and this apartment is your collateral. I still have your power of attorney. And, if you don’t get out, I’ll hire boys who hit only once—the second time they’ll be pounding the nails into your coffin. But you, you won’t be buried. You’ll be feeding dogs or fish in the pond. Got it?”<br><br>“Your wife told me that you sold her apartment. Is it true?”<br><br>“What wife?”<br><br>“The one with the dogs. Whose leg is hurt.”<br><br>“You mean Limping Vera?” Adik laughed. “I’ve got wives like her to fill a stadium. So get your ass out of here. I’ve already sold this apartment again, to some new Russians.”<br><br>Outside, on the stairs, the painter could hear familiar voices: braying, fighting, a child’s wailing.<br><br>“Wait a minute. These new Russians, did they already pay you?”<br><br>“Why do you care?”<br><br>“I’ll tell you why: their money is fake, understand? As soon as you show one bill, you’ll be arrested.” The painter was lying his head off. “Look, Adik, I rented my room to these people, and they paid me in advance. When I went to buy bread with their money, the cashier started screaming. I barely got away.”<br><br>Adik glanced down at his breast pocket, which was bulging out of his shirt like a balcony on a house. “I see,” he said, thinking fast. “You stay here, O.K.? Don’t let them in. Hold down the fort. I’m not here, you understand?”<br><br>“Give me the key. I’ll lock the door”—which he did just in time.<br><br>Adik, pale and sweating, listened to the fearful drumming on the door and the chorus of shouts, and whispered, terrified, “What am I to do?”<br><br>“I’ll guard the apartment, but you must move Vera and her family off the street immediately, or they’ll find you through her.”<br><br>“But how am I to get out?”<br><br>“The fire escape leads to the attic. From there, you get onto the roof.”<br><br>Adik climbed out the window. On the way out, he said, “I’ve installed steel bars on the windows. Lock them behind me. Or they’ll climb in.”<br><br>The door was shaking under the new Russians’ onslaught, but it was a steel number, which Adik had also installed.<br><br>The painter barred the windows and made a dash for the easel he had dragged to the apartment: since he didn’t have another canvas, he began to paint right over the previous study of the bakery. Quickly, he sketched the girl, her dogs, and her parents, then he unlocked the shutters and checked outside: the pavement in front of his building was empty.<br><br>The painter remained in his apartment. He ate the oatmeal and buckwheat he found in the kitchen and listened closely to the bedlam on the stairs. A huge migrant family seemed to be camping out there, occupying every step. He heard singing; the stomping of little feet, like a pack of ponies; loud scenes initiated by complaining tenants from lower floors. Judging by their shrieks, the elevator was also occupied—by the paterfamilias himself. The others constantly directed traffic in that direction: “Roma’s in the elevator! On the cushion! Go talk to him!” The painter could vividly picture the occupants of the stairwell, sitting and sleeping in descending rows, as if in a theatre, and Roma in a leather jacket, perched on a cushion in the elevator, like a soloist on a stage.<br><br>But none of that troubled him much. He was preoccupied with his painting. It made him feel that Vera’s family belonged to him alone. All day long, he tinkered with the portrait. He changed the girl’s expression: sometimes she looked at him tenderly, sometimes ironically. He gave the blind dog one eye; the cat’s cage became roomier; and so on.<br><br>Finally, the morning came when he cooked the last handful of rice and opened the last can of cat food, which smelled vaguely of meat. And right then in the window, behind the steel bars, Adik’s face appeared. He was waiting patiently on the fire escape, tapping on the glass like a pigeon. The painter approached the window and shook his head.<br><br>“Just let me in, please!”<br><br>“Don’t even ask.”<br><br>“Name your conditions,” Adik pleaded.<br><br>“You must marry Vera.”<br><br>“Have you lost your mind, pal?”<br><br>“Look, I have enough food here to last me three years. I have water, gas, and heat, and the apartment is legally mine,” the painter announced in a steely voice.<br><br>“If I marry her, will you give it up?” Adik asked.<br><br>“Sure.”<br><br>“Then I’ll marry her tomorrow—whatever. Where is that lame fool?”<br><br>“Except the place will be hers and hers alone. You won’t have the right to resell.”<br><br>Adik swiftly disappeared up the fire escape.<br><br>From this conversation, the painter gathered to his dismay that Vera and her parents weren’t living with Adik and that they had vanished in an unknown direction.<br><br>Forgetting everything, he rushed out the door to look for them, but, before he had time to lock it, the staircase occupants swept past him and into the apartment, like floodwaters through a breached dam. They filled the hallway in a single torrent, then split into smaller streams that poured into the rooms. There were sacks, bags, feather mattresses, children, samovars, pillows. The invaders didn’t celebrate but, rather, brawled and argued, fighting for space. In the back room, the grand piano boomed: someone must have jumped inside it and others were banging on the keys. The huge Roma, who sailed in clad in jeans, white Nikes, and a leather jacket, hugging his cushion, with a feather stuck to his cheek, closed the ranks. He looked here and there and finally headed into the bathroom, which for some reason remained unoccupied.<br><br>Just a minute before, it had been a hungry, empty dwelling. Now there were people dozing everywhere, kids climbing over prone bodies, women quarrelling in the kitchen, dishes and pots banging.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>“You hungry?” a blimp of a female wrapped in numerous shawls inquired of the poor painter.<br><br>The painter said, “No, thank you,” and squeezed his way back to his easel. A pack of brats had surrounded it. Someone had figured out how to unscrew the tops of the paint tubes and had squeezed the contents all over the canvas. The painting was covered with a thick layer of crimson paint, like blood.<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65151f743c6ee49a5446]<br><br>The precious portrait of Vera’s family had been ruined.<br><br>The painter sighed and began to paint over the vandalized portrait. Against the red background appeared a score of eyes: the children’s, lively and filled with curiosity; the old folks’, dull and half-closed; the women’s, large and sly. Next, the painter depicted sacks, feather beds, floral skirts and shawls, pots and pans, a red copper samovar, already hot, inside a circle of scarlet china cups on a white tablecloth spread on the floor, golden bagels, a plate of raspberry candy, sliced black bread, and an enormous teapot.<br><br>A single small canvas somehow accommodated the entire uncomplicated life of this nomadic clan. “Me, too! Me, too!” the children squealed, and the painter generously painted each and every one. He lost track of time. When the painting was almost done, he heard behind him a soft sobbing sound. He looked around and discovered that the room was almost empty; alone in the far corner sat a little girl, holding a baby. The painter understood that she wanted to be included in the painting and found a spot for her. He sketched her skirts, her beads, her tears, her skinny arms around the tiny baby, then the baby’s pink cheeks and thick black eyelashes, and the dark down on its doll-like head.<br><br>Once the painter had transported this pair onto his canvas, the apartment filled with an echoing silence. He rinsed his brushes and looked around. The girl and the baby had disappeared. He noticed a samovar wrapped in a motley shawl; exhausted, he pushed himself to add it to the painting.<br><br>Now he could take a breath. He lifted his eyes from the painting and discovered that the samovar was gone. The family must have retrieved it. Why had they left? Were they afraid of being painted? The painter bolted the doors, just in case, and heard a snoring sound coming from the bathroom. The mighty Roma was asleep in the tub, on a pile of feather beds. “How could I forget the elephant in the china shop!” the painter asked himself, and he rushed to add Roma to his family portrait. He depicted him on top of all the sacks that were piled on the grand piano. The work went magically fast: ten strokes, and Roma was hovering above his clan. The painter visited the bathroom to check on the likeness. Roma’s throne was empty. The door remained bolted. No one had left the apartment. The windows were still barred.<br><br>The painter collapsed on the floor, genuinely scared. Had the entire gang climbed into his painting? And, if so, what had happened to the rest of his subjects—the customer with the baguette, the hag in the orange housedress? What about the family with five dogs?<br><br>That canvas and those paints—had they belonged to Izvosia, the old classmate? The simplest object can become a tool of destruction if operated by evil, but when you’re dealing with something as complex as art&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The artist, the creator, may perish like a stray dog, in poverty and disgrace and mental illness, and yet he is capable of stopping time itself.<br><br>Terrified, the painter stared at his painting, and back at him stared the migrant family, whom he had probably murdered.<br><br>Grabbing the canvas, the easel, and the paints, the painter raced to his favorite intersection, to the bakery.<br><br>An enormous construction site had replaced it. A huge foundation pit, full of earth and crawling machines, had swallowed the nineteenth-century alley. Trembling over the fresh grave of his beloved site, the painter understood what Izvosia’s gift had meant. Nothing that had appeared on the canvas would ever come back. The world was coming to an end. Who knows how many such canvases the old classmate had distributed in art stores and on street corners?<br><br>He couldn’t dump those tools of death—they would be found by others. The painter trudged through the streets, looking for the spot where he’d picked them up. Everywhere he encountered fresh ruins, through which prowled huge mechanisms that resembled bloodthirsty dinosaurs.<br><br>The painter wanted to find Izvosia, make a deal with him, persuade him to take back his “equipment” and release everyone who had been trapped inside it. He intended to offer Izvosia his apartment; he couldn’t pay the lawyer, anyway. Or Izvosia could take the painter’s life—what did he need it for, if Vera and her entire family had perished?<br><br>Finally, it seemed to the painter that he had reached the cursed spot. (His visual memory was impeccable.) This was where the street ended; here had stood the abandoned building and the concrete wall.<br><br>Only now, in its place, rose a brand-new mansion: five stories high, with a turret, an array of balconies, a red tiled roof, and a thick stone wall crowned with barbed wire. The painter pressed the bell in the wall, but the only response was a blood-chilling howling of dogs inside, as though they were being tortured with electric current. The mansion remained silent.<br><br>Out of sheer habit, the painter reached for the easel, set it up, squeezed out some paints, positioned the cursed canvas, and began to paint over the previous painting.<br><br>He quickly traced the contours of the mansion and the wall, and laid out some cool blue shadows and warm patches of light, hints of the first green leaves, splotches of curtain in the windows. He left nothing out, except for a crow that had perched on the edge of the roof. He didn’t want to kill an innocent bird. In one of the windows, a curtain jerked aside and a pale circle of a face with a gaping mouth appeared for a moment. The painter quickly drew a white circle and a black comma and the face disappeared. In another window, something black and oily gleamed briefly—possibly a handgun—but the painter laid down a precise stroke and the black spot vanished.<br><br>He was working diligently, and the mansion began to erase itself, to melt like a sugar cube in hot tea. The turret became transparent—he could see the supporting beams—and the crow took off in horror from the vanishing roof. The carefully depicted wall disappeared next, and the painter glimpsed a plump figure clad in a brocade robe, holding the leashes of two foaming dogs. Two seconds—and the painted dogs were scowling on the canvas.<br><br>Naturally, the painter avoided depicting the sky, the forest on the horizon, the neighboring buildings, and the little flock of goats on a hillock nearby.<br><br>“You!” exclaimed a headless figure still wearing its brocade robe and velvet shoes. “Igor, buddy, let’s come to an agreement.”<br><br>“Just wait.” The painter quickly copied down the headless figure, and its disembodied voice howled from nothingness.<br><br>“What have you achieved, exactly? Without a body, I can’t help you. I can only destroy you. Erase me from the painting; then I’ll do anything you want.”<br><br>“Fine. If you release everyone else, I’ll release you. And I want them to reappear right this minute.”<br><br>“Now we’re talking,” the voice said. “I knew you were an honest chap. You always handed over your lunch money without a peep. Now I’ll pay you back. This is what you need to say: *Ciao*, *ciao*, *bambino*. Bye-bye, baby. The ones you painted last will come alive first. The others you’ll find where you left them, I swear on my honor.”<br><br>“*Ciao*, *ciao*, *bambino*,” the painter said quickly. And immediately the canvas turned blank. First, the mansion reappeared, then the cheerful and filthy horde, led by Roma, who instantly vaulted the concrete wall, dragging with them their samovars, feather beds, and children. Their faces flickered in the windows, then on the roof. Screaming, “I’ll kill the bastards!,” the resurrected owner in his brocade robe dashed through the gate to let loose the revived dogs, but the painter quickly transposed him and the dogs back onto the canvas.<br><br>In the mansion’s windows, there were already pillows and sheets hanging. Smoke billowed from the chimney; kids were shrieking in the yard, crushing the lilac bushes. The clan had recommenced normal life.<br><br>The disembodied voice pleaded sadly, “Come on, say it one more time! Say *Ciao*, *ciao*, *bambino*, or else I’ll be talking to you forever.”<br><br>“Go ahead! I’ll buy ear plugs,” the painter replied. He threw the equipment over the wall and headed home, to the sound of the canvas being ripped apart and the triumphant howl of the brats bouncing on the wooden easel.<br><br>Half an hour later, he faced a familiar scene: on the sidewalk in front of his building, the cat and the dogs were eating out of their bowls, and the humans were still sitting on their suitcases, waiting. The painter approached them, key in hand. “Your apartment is free,” he said. “You can move back in.” He grabbed a bundle of books. The parents reached for the suitcases, Vera pulled the dogs toward the elevator, and everyone went upstairs.<br><br>Afterward, it seems, things proceeded smoothly for the painter. He eventually married Vera—after first warning her that he painted only abstract compositions that didn’t bring in much income. Also, he warned her that from time to time he heard a voice showering him with reproach. Nothing to worry about—just a little quirk of his. “It’s because you’re a silly one,” Vera told him. “Always were and always will be.”<br><br>align-center<br><br>(*Translated, from the Russian, by Anna Summers*.)&nbsp;♦<br><br>
