They had become, also, a little pro-nuke. Married for two decades of precious, precious life, she and Rafe seemed currently to be partners only in anger and dislike, their old, lusty love mutated to rage. It was both their shame and demise that hate (like love) could not live on air. And so in this, their newly successful project together, they were complicitous and synergistic. They were nurturing, homeopathic, and enabling. They spawned and raised their hate together, cardiovascularly, spiritually, organically. In tandem, as a system, as a dance team of bad feeling, they had shoved their hate center stage and shone a spotlight down for it to seize. *Do your stuff*, *baby! Who is the best*? *Who*’*s the man*?<br><br>“Pro-nuke? You are? Really?” Kit was asked by her friends, to whom she continued, indiscreetly, to complain.<br><br>“Well, no.” Kit sighed. “But in a way.”<br><br>“Seems like you need someone to talk to.”<br><br>Which hurt Kit’s feelings, since she’d felt that she was talking to *them*. “I’m simply concerned about the kids,” she said.<br><br>Rafe had changed. His smile was just a careless yawn, or was his smile just stuck carelessly on? Which was the correct lyric? She didn’t know. But, for sure, he had changed. In Beersboro, one put things neutrally, like that. Such changes were couched. No one ever said that a man was now completely fucked-up. They said, “The guy has changed.” Rafe had started to make model rockets in the basement. He’d become *a little different*. He was something of a *character*. The brazen might suggest, “He’s gotten into some weird shit.” The rockets were tall, plastic, penile-shaped things to which Rafe carefully shellacked authenticating military decals. What had happened to the handsome hippie she’d married? He was prickly and remote, empty with fury. A blankness had entered his blue-green eyes. They stayed wide and bright but non-functional, like dime-store jewelry. She wondered if this was a nervous breakdown, the genuine article. But it persisted for months, and she began to suspect, instead, a brain tumor. Occasionally, he catcalled and wolf-whistled across his mute alienation, his pantomime of hate momentarily collapsed. “Hey, cutie,” he’d call to her from the stairs, after not having looked her in the eye for two months. It was like being snowbound with someone’s demented uncle: should marriage be like that? She wasn’t sure.<br><br>She seldom saw him anymore when he got up in the morning and rushed off to his office. And when he came home from work he’d disappear down the basement stairs. Nightly, in the anxious conjugal dusk that was now their only life together, after the kids had gone to bed, the house would fill up with fumes. When she called down to him about this, he never answered. He seemed to have turned into some sort of space alien. Of course, later she would understand that all this meant that he was involved with another woman, but at the time, protecting her own vanity and sanity, she was working with two hypotheses only: brain tumor or space alien.<br><br>“All husbands are space aliens,” her friend Jan said on the phone.<br><br>“God help me, I had no idea.” Kit began spreading peanut butter on a pretzel and eating quickly. “He’s in such disconnect. His judgment is so bad.”<br><br>“Not on the planet he lives on. On his planet, he’s a veritable Solomon. ‘Bring the stinkin’ baby to me now!’ ”<br><br>“Do you think people can be rehabilitated and forgiven?”<br><br>“Sure! Look at Ollie North.”<br><br>“He lost that Senate race. He was not sufficiently forgiven.”<br><br>“But he got some votes.”<br><br>“Yeah, and now what is he doing?”<br><br>“Now he’s promoting a line of fire-retardant pajamas. It’s a life!” She paused. “Do you fight about it?”<br><br>“About what?” Kit asked.<br><br>“The rockets back to his homeland.”<br><br>Kit sighed again. “Yes, the toxic military-crafts business poisoning our living space. Do I fight? I don’t fight, I just, well, O.K.—I ask a few questions from time to time. I ask, ‘What the hell are you doing?’ I ask, ‘Are you trying to asphyxiate your entire family?’ I ask, ‘Did you hear me?’ Then I ask, ‘Did you hear me?’ again. Then I ask, ‘Are you deaf?’ I also ask, ‘What do you think a marriage is? I’m really just curious to know,’ and also, ‘Is this your idea of a well-ventilated place?’ A simple interview, really. I don’t believe in fighting. I believe in giving peace a chance. I also believe in internal bleeding.” She paused to shift the phone more comfortably against her face. “I’m also interested,” Kit said, “in those forensically undetectable dissolving plastic bullets. Have you heard of those?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“Well, maybe I’m wrong about those. I’m probably wrong. That’s where the Mysterious Car Crash may have to come in.”<br><br>In the chrome of the refrigerator she caught the reflection of her own face, part brunette Shelley Winters, part potato, the finely etched sharps and accidentals beneath her eyes a musical interlude amid the bloat. In every movie she had seen with Shelley Winters in it, Shelley Winters was the one who died.<br><br>Peanut butter was stuck high and dry on Kit’s gums. On the counter, a large old watermelon had begun to sag and pull apart in the middle along the curve of seeds, like a shark’s grin, and she lopped off a wedge, rubbed its cool point around the inside of her mouth. It had been a year since Rafe kissed her. She sort of cared and sort of didn’t. A woman had to choose her own particular unhappiness carefully. That was the only happiness in life: choosing the best unhappiness. An unwise move and, good God, you could squander everything.<br><br>The summons took her by surprise. It came in the mail, addressed to her, and there it was, stapled to divorce papers. She’d been properly served. The bitch had been papered. Like a person, a marriage was unrecognizable in death, even when buried in its favorite suit. Atop the papers themselves was a letter from Rafe suggesting their spring wedding anniversary as the final divorce date. “Why not complete the symmetry?” he wrote, which didn’t even sound like him, though its heartless efficiency was suited to this, his new life as a space alien, and generally in keeping with the principles of space-alien culture.<br><br>The papers referred to Kit and Rafe by their legal names, Katherine and Raphael, as if the more formal versions of them were the ones who were divorcing—their birth certificates were divorcing!—and not they themselves. Rafe was still living in the house and had not yet told her that he’d bought a new one. “Honey,” she said, trembling, “something very interesting came in the mail today.”<br><br>Rage had its medicinal purposes, but she was not wired to sustain it, and when it tumbled away loneliness engulfed her, grief burning at the center with a cold blue heat. At the funerals of two different elderly people she hardly knew, she wept in the back row of the church like a secret lover of the deceased. She felt woozy and ill and never wanted to see Rafe—or, rather, Raphael—again, but they had promised the kids this Caribbean vacation; it was already booked, so what could they do?<br><br>This, at last, was what all those high-school drama classes had been for: acting. She had once played the queen in “A Winter’s Tale,” and once a changeling child in a play called “Love Me Right Now,” written by one of the more disturbing English teachers in her high school. In both of these performances, she had learned that time was essentially a comic thing—only constraints upon it diverted it to tragedy, or, at least, to misery. Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde—if only they’d had more time! Marriage stopped being comic when it was suddenly halted, at which point it became divorce, which time never disturbed and the funniness of which was never-ending.<br><br>Still, Rafe mustered up thirty seconds of utterance in an effort to persuade her not to join him and the children on this vacation. “I don’t think you should go,” he announced.<br><br>“I’m going,” she said.<br><br>“We’ll be giving the children false hope.”<br><br>“Hope is never false. Or it’s always false. Whatever. It’s just hope,” she said. “Nothing wrong with that.”<br><br>“I just don’t think you should go.”<br><br>Divorce, she could see, would be like marriage: a power grab. Who would be the dog and who would be the owner of the dog?<br><br>At this point, however, she and Rafe had not yet signed the papers. And there was still the matter of her wedding ring, which was studded with little junk emeralds and which she liked a lot and hoped she could continue wearing because it didn’t look like a typical wedding ring. He had removed his ring—which did look like a typical wedding ring—a year before, because, he said, “it bothered him.” She had thought at the time that he’d meant it was rubbing. She had not been deeply alarmed; he had often shed his clothes spontaneously—when they first met, he’d been something of a nudist. It was good to date a nudist: things moved right along. But it was not good trying to stay married to one. Soon she would be going on chaste geriatric dates with other people whose clothes would, like hers, remain glued to the body.<br><br>“What if I can’t get my ring off?” she said to him now on the plane. She had gained a little weight during their twenty years of marriage, but really not all that much. She had been practically a child bride!<br><br>“Send me the sawyer’s bill,” he said. Oh, the sparkle in his eye *was* gone!<br><br>“What is wrong with you?” she said. Of course, she blamed his parents, who had somehow, long ago, accidentally or on purpose, raised him as a space alien, with space-alien values, space-alien thoughts, and the hollow, shifty character, concocted guilelessness, and sociopathic secrets of a space alien.<br><br>“What is wrong with *you*?” he snarled. This was his habit, his space-alien habit, of merely repeating what she had just said to him. It had to do, no doubt, with his central nervous system, a silicon-chipped information processor incessantly encountering new linguistic combinations, which it then had to absorb and file. Repetition bought time and assisted the storage process.<br><br>She was less worried about the girls, who were just little, than she was about Sam, her sensitive fourth grader, who now sat across the airplane aisle, moodily staring out the window at the clouds. Soon, through the machinations of the state’s extremely progressive divorce laws—a boy needs his dad!—she would no longer see him every day; he would become a boy who no longer saw his mother every day, and he would scuttle a little and float off and away like paper carried by wind. With time, he would harden: he would eye her over his glasses, in the manner of a maître d’ suspecting riffraff. He would see her coming the way a panicked party guest sees someone without a nametag. But on this, their last trip as an actual family, he did fairly well at not letting on.<br><br>They all slept in the same room, in separate beds, and saw other families squalling and squabbling, so that by comparison theirs—a family about to break apart forever—didn’t look so bad. She was not deceived by the equatorial sea breeze and so did not overbake herself in the colonial sun; with the resort managers, she shared her moral outrage at the armed guards who kept the local boys from sneaking past the fence onto this white, white beach; and she rubbed a kind of resin into her brow to freeze it and downplay the creases—to make her appear younger for her departing husband, though he never once glanced at her. Not that she looked that good: her suitcase had got lost and she was forced to wear clothes purchased from the gift shop—the words “La Caribe” emblazoned across every single thing.<br><br>On the beach, people read books about Rwandan and Yugoslavian genocide. This was to add seriousness to a trip that lacked it. One was supposed not to notice the dark island boys on the other side of the barbed wire, throwing rocks.<br><br>There were ways of making things vanish temporarily. One could disappear oneself, in movement and repetition.<br><br>Sam liked only the trampoline and nothing else. There were dolphin rides, but he sensed their cruelty. “They speak a language,” he said. “We shouldn’t ride them.”<br><br>“They *look* happy,” Kit said.<br><br>Sam studied her with a seriousness from some sweet beyond. “They look happy so you won’t kill them.”<br><br>“You think so?”<br><br>“If dolphins tasted good,” he said, “we wouldn’t even know about their language.” That the intelligence in a thing could undermine your appetite for it. That yumminess obscured the mind of the yummy as well as the mind of the yummer. That deliciousness resulted in decapitation. That you could understand something only if you did not desire it. How did he know such things already? Usually girls knew them first. But not hers. Her girls, Beth and Dale, were tough beyond her comprehension: practical, self-indulgent, independent five-year-old twins, a system unto themselves. They had their own secret world of Montessori code words and plastic jewelry and spells of hilarity brought on mostly by the phrase “cinnamon M&M’s” repeated six times, fast. They wore sparkly fairy wings wherever they went, even over cardigans, and they carried wands. “I’m a big brother now,” Sam had said repeatedly to everyone and with uncertain pride the day the girls were born, and after that he spoke not another word on the matter. Sometimes Kit accidentally referred to Beth and Dale as Death and Bale, as they, for instance, buried their several Barbies in sand, then lifted them out again with glee. A woman on a towel, reading of genocide, turned and smiled. In this fine compound on the sea, the contradictions of life were grotesque and uninventable.<br><br>Kit went to the central office and signed up for a hot-stone massage. “Would you like a man or a woman?” the receptionist asked.<br><br>“Excuse me?” Kit said, stalling. After all these years of marriage, which *did* she want? What did she know of men—or women? “There’s no such thing as ‘men,’ ” Jan used to say. “Every man is different. The only thing they have in common is, well, a capacity for horrifying violence.”<br><br>“A man or a woman—for the massage?” Kit asked. She thought of the slow mating of snails, hermaphrodites for whom it was all so confusing: by the time they had figured out who was going to be the girl and who was going to be the boy, someone came along with some garlic paste and just swooped them right up.<br><br>“Oh, either one,” she said, and then knew she’d get a man.<br><br>Whom she tried not to look at but could smell in all his smoky aromas—tobacco, incense, cannabis—swirling their way around him. A wiry old American pothead gone to grim seed. His name was Daniel Handler, according to the business card he wore safety-pinned to his shirt like a badge. He did not speak. He placed hot stones up and down her back and left them there. Did she think her belotioned flesh too private and precious to be touched by the likes of him? *Are you crazy*? The mad joy in her face was held over the floor by the massage-table headpiece, and at his touch her eyes filled with bittersweet tears, which then dripped out of her nose, which she realized was positioned perfectly by God as a little drainpipe for crying. The sad massage-hut carpet beneath her grew a spot. A heart could break, but perhaps you could move on to the next one, and the next, like a worm with its several hearts. Daniel left the hot stones on her until they went cold. As each one lost its heat, she could no longer feel it there on her back, and then its removal was like a discovery that it had been there all along: how strange to forget and then feel something only then, at the end. Though this wasn’t the same thing as the frog in the pot whose water slowly heats and boils, still it had meaning, she felt, the way metaphors of a thermal nature tended to. Then he took all the stones off and pressed the hard edges of them deep into her back, between the bones, in a way that felt mean but more likely had no intention at all.<br><br>“That was nice,” she said, as he was putting all his stones away. He had heated them in a plastic electric Crockpot filled with water, and now he unplugged the thing in a tired fashion.<br><br>“Where did you get those stones?” she asked. They were smooth and dark gray—black when wet, she saw.<br><br>“They’re river stones,” he said. “I’ve been collecting them for years up in Colorado.” He placed them in a metal fishing-tackle box.<br><br>“You live in Colorado?” she asked.<br><br>“Used to,” he said, and that was that.<br><br>On the last night of their vacation, her suitcase arrived like a joke. She didn’t even open it. Sam put out the little doorknob flag that said “*WAKE US UP FOR THE SEA TURTLES*{: .small}.” The flag had a pre-printed request for a 3 *A*{: .small}.*M*{: .small}. wakeup call so that they could go to the beach and see the hatching of the baby sea turtles and their quick scuttle into the ocean, under the cover of night, to avoid predators. But though Sam had hung the flag carefully, and before the midnight deadline, no staff person woke them. And by the time they got up and went down to the beach it was ten in the morning. Strangely, the sea turtles were still there. They had hatched during the night and then hotel personnel had hung on to them, in a baskety cage, to show them off to the tourists who were too lazy or deaf to have got up in the night.<br><br>“Look, come see!” a man with a Spanish accent who usually rented the scuba gear said. Sam, Beth, Dale, and Kit all ran over. (Rafe had stayed behind to drink coffee and read the paper.) The squirming babies were beginning to heat up in the sun; the goldening Venetian vellum of their wee webbed feet was already edged in desiccating brown. “I’m going to have to let them go now,” the man said. “You are the last ones to see these little *bebés*.” He took them over to the water’s edge and let them go, hours too late, to make their own way into the sea. And that’s when a frigate bird swooped in, plucked them, one by one, from the silver waves, and ate them for breakfast.<br><br>Kit sank down in a large chair next to Rafe. He was tanning himself, she could see, for someone else’s lust. His every posture contained a strut. What bimbo had he wanted to give her ticket to? (Only later would she find out. “As a feminist, you mustn’t blame the other woman,” a neighbor would tell her. “As a feminist, I request that you no longer speak to me,” Kit would reply.)<br><br>“I think I need a drink,” she said. The kids were swimming.<br><br>“Don’t expect me to buy you a drink,” he said.<br><br>Had she even asked? Did she now call him the bitterest name she could think of? Did she stand and turn and slap him across the face in front of several passers-by? Who told you *that*?<br><br>When they finally left La Caribe, she was glad. Staying there, she had begun to hate the world. In the airports and on the planes home, she did not even try to act natural: natural was a felony. She spoke to her children calmly, from a script, with dialogue and stage directions of utter neutrality. Back home in Beersboro, she unpacked the condoms and candles, her little love sack, completely unused, and threw it in the trash. What had she been thinking? Later, when she had learned to tell this story differently, as a story, she would construct a final lovemaking scene of sentimental vengeance that would contain the inviolable center of their love, the sweet animal safety of night after night, the still-beating tender heart of marriage. But, for now, she would become like her unruinable daughters, and even her son, who, as he aged stoically and carried on in bottomless forgetting, would come to scarcely recall—was it even past imagining?—that she and Rafe had ever been together at all. ♦<br><br>
