All facing the same way, too, as though silently venerating the muted dirty sunset beyond the holy city. Motionless at the edge of the ravine, they were miles from the city and the wide flat river that snaked into the glow, where the sun smoldered in a towering heap of dust like a cloud bank. What were they looking at? The light dimmed, went colder, and the creatures stirred.<br><br>“They’re almost human,” Audie Blun-den said, and looked closer at their matted fur.<br><br>With a bark like a bad cough, the biggest monkey raised his curled tail, lowered his arms, and thrust forward on his knuckles. The others, skittering on smaller limbs, followed him, their tails nodding, and the great troop of straggling monkeys moved along the road and up the embankment toward the stringy trees at the edge of the forest.<br><br>“They scare me,” Beth Blunden said, and though the nearest monkey was more than fifteen feet away she could feel the prickle of its grubby fur creeping across the bare skin of her arm.<br><br>But Audie hadn’t heard. He was peering into the thickening dusk. “Incredible,” he said, in a whisper. “I think they were watching the sunset, just lingering for the last warmth of the sun. Like us.”<br><br>Beth stared at him, not because of what he’d said but the way he’d said it. He sounded so pompous, chewing on this simple observation. They travelled a lot, and she had noticed that travel often made her normally straightforward husband pretentious.<br><br>They were at the edge of a low summit, one of the foothills of the Himalayas. From farther up the ridge, where they were staying—a health spa called Agni—on a clear day they could see snow-topped peaks. They had come to Agni planning to stay a week. The week had passed quickly; they’d stayed another, and now they had agreed to renew their arrangement from week to week, telling themselves that they’d leave when they were ready.<br><br>They were world travellers, yet they’d never seen anything like this. The file of monkeys hurried up the road, with an odd skip-drag gait, the big bold leader up front, now and then barking in his severe way.<br><br>“Good evening.”<br><br>A man emerged from the twilit road, stepping neatly to allow the file of monkeys to pass by. The Blundens were not startled. Their time here had prepared them. They had not seen much of India, but they knew that whenever they hesitated anywhere, looking puzzled or even thoughtful, an Indian would step forward to explain, usually an old man, a bobble-headed pedant, a man urgent with irrelevancies. This one wore a white shirt, a thick vest and scarf, baggy pants, and sandals. Big horn-rimmed glasses distorted his eyes.<br><br>“I see you are in process of observing our monkeys.”<br><br>Like the other explainers, this one precisely summed up what they’d been doing.<br><br>“Do not be perplexed,” he went on.<br><br>It was true—they had been perplexed.<br><br>“They are assembling each evening. They are taking last of warmth into bodies.” He had a voluptuous and slightly starved way of saying “bodies,” giving the word flesh.<br><br>“I figured so,” Audie said. “That’s what I said to my wife—didn’t I, Beth?”<br><br>“They are also looking at smoke and fires at temple in town.”<br><br>That was another thing they’d found. Indians like this never listened. They would deliver a monologue, usually informative but oddly without emphasis, as though it were a recitation, and did not appear to be interested in anything that the Blundens had to say.<br><br>“What temple? What town?” the Blundens asked at once.<br><br>The Indian was pointing into the darkness. “When sun is down, monkeys hasten away—see—to the trees where they will spend night hours, safe from harm’s way. Yes, leopards are there. Not one or two but abundant. Monkeys are their meat.”<br><br>“Meat” was another delicious word, which the man uttered as though tempted by it, giving it the sinewy density of something forbidden. But he hadn’t answered them.<br><br>“There’s leopards here on Monkey Hill?” Audie asked.<br><br>The old man seemed to wince in disapproval, and Audie guessed it was his saying “Monkey Hill”—but that was what most people at Agni called it, and it was easier to remember than its Indian name.<br><br>“It is believed that Hanuman Giri is exact place where monkey god Hanuman plucked the mountain of herbals and healing plants for restoring life of Rama’s brother Lakshman.”<br><br>Yes, that was it, Hanuman Giri. At first they’d thought that he was answering their question about leopards, but what was this about herbals?<br><br>“As you can find in Ramayana,” the Indian said, and pointed with his skinny hand. “There, do you see mountain beyond some few trees?” He did not wait for a reply. “Not at all. It is empty space, where mountain once stood. Now it is town and temple. Shrine, so to say.”<br><br>“No one mentioned any temple.”<br><br>“At one time was Muslim mosque, built five centuries before, Mughal era, on site of Hanuman temple. Ten years ago, trouble, people invading mosque and burning. Hanuman is deity in image of monkey, as Ganesh is image of elephant,” the Indian said. “And what is your country, if you please?”<br><br>“We’re Americans,” Beth said, happy at last to have been asked.<br><br>“There are many wonders here,” the Indian said, unimpressed. “You could stay here whole lifetime and still not see everything.”<br><br>He was scowling at the valley he had described, where the mountain had been uprooted.<br><br>“How old do you think I am?” he asked. “You will never guess.”<br><br>“Seventy-something?”<br><br>“I am in my eighty-third year. I do yoga meditation every morning for one hour. I have never tasted meat, nor alcoholic beverage. Now I will go home and take little dhal and puri and curd, that is all.”<br><br>“Where do you live?”<br><br>“Just here. Hanuman Nagar.”<br><br>“Your village?”<br><br>“Township of Hanuman Nagar is substantial, with a market and textiles weaving and sundry spheres of commercial enterprise, including ironmongers, potmaking, clay-baking, for house tiles, kilns, and enamelling.”<br><br>“No one mentioned a town,” Audie said.<br><br>“As well as fruit and nut trees. I myself am wholesaling nut meats. Also, as mentioned, Hanuman shrine. Ancient temple. I bid you good evening.”<br><br>With that he stepped into the darkness. The Blundens walked up the road in the opposite direction, remarking, as they went, on the poise of the old man, his self-possession, his pedantry. How easy it was to jeer at him, yet he had told them several things they hadn’t known—the town, its industries, the Hanuman story, the temple business. What they had been thinking of as simply Monkey Hill had a history, and drama, and now, on that lower slope, a settlement.<br><br>“Did you understand what he said about the mosque and the temple?” Beth asked.<br><br>Audie shrugged and said, “You get these Indians talking and they’ll flog a dead horse into dog food.”<br><br>They had a surprise on their way up the road, walking back through the gate to the lodge. They had seen the gate when they came down but they had not noticed the signs: “Right of Entry Prohibited Except by Registered Guests” and “No Trespassing” and “Authorized Vehicles Only.”<br><br>“This means you!” Audie said, shaking his finger into the darkness. “Get your happy ass out of here!”<br><br>“You’re awful, Butch,” Beth said, and giggled because it was dark and they were in India, alone on this road, dust in their nostrils, and here he was making a joke, being silly. His unruly behavior was a comfort to her; she had loved him for it and regarded it as a form of protection for more than thirty years.<br><br>Beyond the gateway, they saw the lights of the lodge, and Agni itself, the former maharaja’s residence, a baronial mansion, and in the bamboo grove the spa buildings, the pool, the palm trees, the yoga pavilion, glowing in spotlights, the whole place crowning the summit of the hill. Staff members passing them on the path pressed their hands together in prayer and said “*Namaste*” or “*Namaskar*,” and some of the Tibetans, in an attractive gesture, touched their right hands to their hearts. Audie did the same in return and found himself moved by it.<br><br>They were getting up to leave the dinner table when they heard a sharp “Hello.” An Indian man had materialized next to them, carrying a clipboard.<br><br>“Doctor,” Beth said—she had forgotten his name but then she saw his Agni nameplate. “Dr. Nagaraj.”<br><br>He had told them earlier that he would see them at dinner, and they had forgotten. But he was unfussed, saying “Not to worry” as they apologized.<br><br>“We’ve already eaten,” Audie said, seeing the waitress approach with three menus. She stood next to the table, looking serene, patient, attentive. He smiled at the girl. The nameplate pinned to her yellow-and-white sari was lettered “Anna.” She had a pale, round face, like a doll’s; her hair in a bun, drawn back tight, gave her prominent ears. She was lovely. He’d seen her at the spa in the white pajamas the massage therapists wore.<br><br>“Is that short for something—maybe Annapurna?” he asked her.<br><br>“No, sir. Mother of Mary. I am Christian, sir.”<br><br>“Imagine that.”<br><br>“From Nagaland, sir. Kohima, sir. Very far, sir.”<br><br>“I’ve seen you in the spa.”<br><br>“I also do treatments in daytime, sir.”<br><br>“Are you eating, Doctor?” Audie said.<br><br>“Thank you, no. I don’t take food after 6 *P.M.*{: .small}” He spoke to the girl. “I will take some salted lassi.”<br><br>“We should follow your example,” Beth said.<br><br>“As you wish.”<br><br>“Three of those, Anna, please.”<br><br>“Thank you, sir.” She stepped silently away, clutching the menus.<br><br>“Where did you say you went to medical school?” Audie asked.<br><br>“Ayurvedic Institute in Mangalore.”<br><br>“That makes you a doctor?”<br><br>“Ayurvedic doctor, yes.”<br><br>“Can you practice outside India?”<br><br>“Where Ayurvedic medicine is licensed,” Dr. Nagaraj said. “May I see your right hand, sir?” And when Audie placed his big hand in the doctor’s warm slender one, the doctor said, “Just relax,” and scrutinized it, and made some notes on his clipboard. Still holding Audie’s palm, the doctor raised his eyes and did not smile.<br><br>“You had a hard life until age thirty-five,” he said. “You prepared the ground, so to say. Then you reaped rewards. Next ten years very good for name and fame. Madam?”<br><br>He offered his hand to Beth and she placed hers, palm upward, on his.<br><br>“How long will I live?” Audie said.<br><br>“Until eighty-five, if all is observed,” the doctor said without hesitating. He went back to examining Beth’s palm, and scribbling notes.<br><br>“I don’t want to know how long I’m going to live,” Beth said. “Just give me some good news.”<br><br>“Happy childhood, but you have no children yourself,” the doctor said. “Next ten years, excellent health. Never trust any person blindly, especially those who praise you. Follow intuition. Avoid crowds, smoke, dust.” The doctor strained, as though translating from a difficult language. “Avoid perfume. No litigation.”<br><br>As the doctor tensed, showing his teeth, Beth said, “That’s enough,” and lifted her hand away. Audie glanced at her and assumed that she was also wondering whether Dr. Nagaraj was a quack. But that thought was not in her mind.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj sipped his lassi. He nodded and tapped his clipboard.<br><br>“I took my friend Sanjeev to Rajaji National Forest to see the wild elephants. They are my passion. Did you not see my collection of Ganeshes in my office?”<br><br>“I remember,” Beth said. “The elephant figurines on the shelves.”<br><br>“Quite so.” The doctor drank again. “We encountered a great herd of elephants in Rajaji. They are not the same as the working domesticated elephants but a separate matter. They saw us. We were near the banks of the river. Do you know the expression ‘Never get between an elephant and water’?”<br><br>“I guess we do now,” Audie said.<br><br>“The elephants became enraged. I saw the bull elephant trumpeting and I ran and hid in the trees. Sanjeev was behind me, rooted to the spot, too frightened to move. I watched with horror as the huge elephant bore down on him, followed by the herd of smaller elephants, raising so much dust. Seeing them, Sanjeev bowed his head and knelt, knowing he was about to die. He couldn’t run, he couldn’t swim. But he did yoga—*bidalasana*, cat position, instinctive somehow.”<br><br>Flexing his fingers, making a business of it, Dr. Nagaraj straightened the mat in front of him, tidied the coaster under his glass, then dipped his head and sucked at the lassi.<br><br>“What happened?” Audie asked.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj went vague, his face slackening, then, “Oh, yes,” as he pretended to remember what he’d been saying. “The great bull elephant lowered his head as though to charge. But instead of impaling Sanjeev on his tusks, as I had expected, the elephant knelt, trapping him between the two great tusks. Not to kill him, oh, no. It was to protect him from the other elephants’ trampling him.”<br><br>He seemed to be on the point of saying more when Beth announced that she was exhausted, that she would be a basket case if she didn’t get some sleep.<br><br>They woke to a brilliant sunrise and felt that days like this existed only on this hilltop. The rest of India and the stormy world were elsewhere.<br><br>Was it three weeks they’d been here? Or four? They had lost their sense of passing time. Being at Agni had strengthened them—it was like a cure for an obscure but tenacious ailment of which they’d been unaware. Rested, well looked after, like children on an extended holiday, they were invigorated, enjoying the power of contentment. Audie had even stopped teasing the waiters about the food, had stopped calling the uttapam “shit on a shingle.”<br><br>The staff waited on the Blundens, devoted, and prescient, too, anticipating their desires. When they skipped meals, the waiters would say, “We missed you last night,” as though their absence were a diminishment.<br><br>The Blundens were, to their surprise, grateful. They were wealthy, they owned four homes in four different states, and they knew all about employees and servants. They had gardeners, housekeepers, caretakers, but all of them were so well paid and so used to their employers as to be presumptuous. *You need us* seemed to show in their resentful eyes. Indian workers were neither presumptuous nor servile; well spoken, even educated, they were like people from another planet, whose eyes said, *We need you*.<br><br>“I should start a company here,” Audie said. “Or do what everyone else is doing, outsource here.”<br><br>They had arrived at Mumbai Airport one dark smoky midnight and had been driven swiftly past lamplit shacks to an enormous hotel, where they stayed in the Elephanta Suite—Audie intoned the name printed over the carved doorway. At dawn, they were taken back to the airport for the flight to the holy city, where they were met by a driver in a white uniform holding a platter of chilled face towels. All the Blundens had seen of India—the populous and chaotic India they’d been warned about, the India that made you sick and fearful and impatient—was the one-hour drive from the airport to the top of Monkey Hill. Audie thought of the drive as a long panning shot, the sort you’d get in a documentary with a jumping camera, the very first image a woman with no hands, begging at a stoplight just outside the airport, raising her stumps to Audie’s window (“Don’t look, honey”), then the overloaded lopsided trucks with “Horn Please” lettered on their bumpers, the oxcarts piled high with bulging sacks sharing the road with crammed buses painted blue and red, women slapping clothes onto boulders in a dirty stream, others threshing grain on mats. Whitewashed temples, mosques with minarets like sharpened pencils, the lean-tos and tents of squatters. Every few miles, huge billboards showing movie posters of bug-eyed fatties in tight clothes. This India had no smell and hardly any sound: the windows of the car were closed, the air-conditioner on.<br><br>“They’ve got zip,” Audie said, his face to the car window. And, in conversation with various Indian guests at Agni, “Sure, I saw the Indian miracle.”<br><br>The miracle to the Blundens was that India was not a country but a creature, like an elephantine body bristling with insect life, pestilential with people. And another miracle was that they’d found the remote part of it that was safe.<br><br>Agni was in the heart of India, yet India seemed far away. Perhaps that was the secret to experiencing this country: you had to bury yourself so deeply in it that you avoided suffering it. The few times at Agni when they’d seen something exotic or strange—like the monkeys staring at the sunset—it was not anything they’d anticipated, not the India of stereotype, and that was so disconcerting that they withdrew through the Agni gate and shut India out.<br><br>On their way to the yoga pavilion that morning, they saw ropes of smoke untangling in the sky, in the direction where the old man had pointed with his skinny hand. There was an earthy smell of damp flowers and also the smell of the distant fire.<br><br>Half a dozen others had preceded them to the pavilion, and were already sitting on rush mats, in the lotus position, some of them with eyes closed in meditation. The Blundens took their places. Vikram, the yoga teacher, sat on a raised platform, his hands clasped under his chin.<br><br>“Om,” Vikram chanted three times. Then, “Rub your hands, massage your eyes, feel the energy, feel the vibration. Open your eyes slowly, listen to the birds singing.”<br><br>The Blundens stood, they stretched, they did “the tree”; they raised their arms, locked their hands.<br><br>“For *tadasana*, mountain pose. Think, This is Hanuman mountain. Find something to concentrate on,” Vikram said. “A brick. A leaf.”<br><br>Audie saw a crack on a pillar of the pavilion. He stared hard at it. It held him up; he balanced on the crack, and it turned from a flaw to a distinct profile, a coastline, something with symmetry and meaning.<br><br>“Now, slowly, lie on mat with feet apart. Inhaling breath, raise legs twenty degrees and slowly let out breath.”<br><br>They assumed the posture of the archer, the cat, the dog, and the crocodile. Without remarking on it to each other, the Blundens knew that they were improving. Beth, who had gripped her calves on the first day, could now touch the mat with her fingertips; Audie, who had trembled with his legs aloft, could now hold the position.<br><br>The end of the session came sooner and sooner. Afterward, they lay for a minute or so, stretched flat on their mats, feeling the cool air on their faces, all the drowsiness of deep sleep wrung from their bodies.<br><br>Lying there today, they were aware of the subtle smoke smell, as well as of something fouler—a whiff of excrement.<br><br>“I am limp,” Audie said. “I feel wonderful.”<br><br>Not limp, Beth thought. She felt, instead, a heightened awareness, a keener sense of smell and touch. She was not soothed so much as set on edge.<br><br>“With each breath,” Audie was saying, “I was sort of inhaling peacefulness through my nose, calming myself and getting lighter.”<br><br>Beth smiled at him and said, “It’s lovely—I want to go on doing this when we get home.” Yet nothing that Audie had described was what she had experienced. Lying on her mat, she had felt energy pulsing out of the solid earth and up her spine. Raising her eyes, tipping her head backward, she had sensed more energy pouring into her from the sky. Her fingers were limber, her grip was tested; she received power through her bare feet.<br><br>“Meet you at the pool,” he said. “I’m going up to the lobby to sign on for another week.”<br><br>Later, as they were reading under the sun shade by the pool, they became aware of a stirring just behind them—Audie heard a rustle of feet in dry leaves and the shake of branches, while for Beth it was less a sound than a prickling of her skin, a distinct physicality like a change in temperature, and a sense that she was being watched.<br><br>They both turned, but they saw only a swaying tree limb.<br><br>“Look at the time,” Audie said, twisting his wrist. “I’ve got a treatment.”<br><br>“Which one?”<br><br>“*Abhiyanga*.”<br><br>He did not say that on his way back from the lobby he had stopped by the spa and signed up for this treatment, requesting that his massage therapist be Anna, whom they had met the previous evening in the restaurant.<br><br>“This way, sir,” she said when he arrived at the spa, leading him up the marble stairs and past the gushing fountain to the massage room. A small dark woman awaited them there. She, too, greeted him, and bowed her head.<br><br>“This is Sarita,” Anna said.<br><br>The two women helped him onto the wooden table, where he lay on his stomach, his face on a folded towel. His first sensation was of hot oil drizzled on the small of his back, fingers stirring it, spreading it, pressing it into his spine. Anna was on one side, Sarita on the other.<br><br>Without effort, Audie sank into a reverie about the women he had known. He always did this when he was massaged. He did not orchestrate the reverie—he just let it wash over him. He guessed that it was his reaction to being touched by a strange woman’s hands. He thought of the women he’d most desired in his life—not the casual sex partners or one-night stands but the affairs that had exhausted him with the pleasure and pain of love. Yet what he recalled about these women, in the course of the massage, was not the beginning of the romance or the succeeding trysts but the last time he’d seen each woman, the day he’d ended things, the point at which his desire had died down and his guilt at deceiving Beth had overcome him. Usually he had waited until after making love to say what he’d rehearsed: “I won’t be able to see you anymore.” Afterward, he had averted his eyes from the woman’s body as she dressed, fearing to be aroused by his pity. Each time, as he waited, the woman seemed to recede, to grow smaller, losing significance—as though she were standing on a railway platform and he were at the window of a train, pulling away, waving goodbye. Although these partings had been painful for him as well, he had always been able to say, “What did you expect? I’m a married man. I have obligations. What about my wife?”<br><br>After each breakup, he’d bought something for Beth—a charm for her bracelet, some flowers, a scarf, a pair of earrings—and offered her the present, saying, “I love you, Tugar. I could never love anyone else.” As a child, unable to pronounce the word “sugar,” she’d said “tugar”—she had told him this once and the name had stuck. He used it only in moments of grateful tenderness, just as in similar moments of gratitude she called him Butch.<br><br>“Be careful, sir.” Anna was wiping the oil from one of his feet, Sarita wiping the other.<br><br>They helped him off the massage table and guided him to the shower, where he scrubbed himself clean. He left the room swaying slightly, fatigued and stunned by the experience.<br><br>At lunch, Beth said, “How was it?”<br><br>“The treatment? Very nice.”<br><br>They were sitting outside, the sun-speckled shade falling across their table.<br><br>“Did you swim?” Audie asked.<br><br>“I wasn’t in the mood,” she said. “I’ve got a treatment now,” she added, setting her soup spoon down, patting her lips with her napkin.<br><br>They kissed, brushing cheeks, puckering, a sound like tasting air.<br><br>As Beth walked through the bamboo grove to the spa, she passed the gift shop. A woman in an Agni sari standing at the door stepped aside and said, “Please. You are welcome.”<br><br>“I’m running late, but I wanted to know if you have any shahtooshes.”<br><br>“We can obtain,” the woman said, a sweep of her head indicating her complete coöperation. “But it is not easy.”<br><br>“In what way not easy?”<br><br>“It is contraband item.”<br><br>“I was thinking of looking in the town. I didn’t even know there was a town!”<br><br>“Hanuman Nagar. Not available. Not hygienic.”<br><br>“But there’s the monkey temple?”<br><br>“Shrine, yes, but not temple. Disputed temple, so to say.”<br><br>“I’m sure it’s interesting,” Beth said, because the woman was agitated, as the Indians at Agni seemed to be when they were contradicted, or even questioned.<br><br>“There is such confusion, Madam. Even hullabaloo,” the woman said, widening her eyes. “Please, you desire shahtoosh, we will obtain full range of shahtoosh for you, with discretion.”<br><br>At the spa, Beth was met by a young girl in a white uniform, in a posture of greeting, hands clasped, head bowed. “*Namaskar*. I am Prithi.”<br><br>On the way to the massage suite, Prithi complimented Beth on her lovely bag (“It is smart, Madam”) and on her clear skin. Beth thanked her, but thought, Why not? I take care of myself. I eat right. I exercise. I’m only fifty. She was fifty-three, but what was the difference? The next big birthday was far off and unthinkable.<br><br>Prithi helped her onto the table and tucked a towel around her.<br><br>“Thai massage, Madam.”<br><br>“Yes,” Beth murmured into the cushion under her face.<br><br>She was tugged, first her shoulders and back, her legs pushed and pulled, each part of her body proving its elasticity; the physicality of the treatment was like an acknowledgment that she was fully alive. And there was something else—the oddness of having an Indian girl, hardly twenty, caress her this way. No man apart from Audie had ever seen her like this. But the rhythm of the massage, the hands moving across her skin, the sense of blood being expressed through her muscles—it all induced in her the sensation of being embraced and warmed by another body. She did not mind that the other person was a woman—she was, in fact, reassured by the thought that only another woman would understand.<br><br>Audie was peering into the fishpond outside the dining-room lobby, seeming to stare at the white-andorange koi gulping at bubbles, but he was only killing time, looking sideways at Anna, who had changed into her restaurant uniform, the yellow-and-white sari.<br><br>“Good treatment, sir?” Anna said, coming up behind him.<br><br>“The best,” he said.<br><br>“Thank you, sir.”<br><br>He turned to size her up, wondering if she knew that she sounded like a coquette. He looked for a nuance on her lips, a lingering light in her eyes.<br><br>“They are lucky fish,” Anna said.<br><br>“Lucky in what way?”<br><br>“One Japanese guest tell me so, sir. Lucky fish.”<br><br>The fish were fat, their fins like wings, their big purselike mouths gasping.<br><br>“Jesus Christ is a fish, sir.”<br><br>Audie dipped his head to the side, as he did when he heard something unexpected.<br><br>“The sign of fish is in all church, sir. Is a symbol, you can say, sir.”<br><br>Do I know this? Audie wondered, yet he was distracted by Anna’s doll-like face, her slightly slanted eyes in puffy sockets, her fleshy lips.<br><br>“Is that on the menu?” Beth said, stepping through the door and seeing her husband and the employee at the rail of the fishpond.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj appeared just then as well, and Anna stepped back and became formal, deferring to a superior in the Indian way.<br><br>“We were discussing the fish,” Audie said.<br><br>“Ah, yes. Fish.” He said *peesh*, making it sound inedible.<br><br>“The Christian symbolism. Jesus is represented as a fish.”<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj waggled his head; he was saying yes, but he didn’t have a clue.<br><br>Anna, self-conscious, sidled back to the table of menus.<br><br>“Will you join us for dinner?” Beth asked.<br><br>As the doctor waggled his head again, Audie said, “Just pineapple juice for me. I’m not eating after six.”<br><br>“Avoid sour juices,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>Beth said, “I’m hungry—I’m eating.”<br><br>The massage had given her an appetite—hunger she took to be a sign of health.<br><br>“Hinduism predates Christianity by many centuries,” Dr. Nagaraj said at the table, without prompting. “You can find god Agni in Rigveda—more than three thousand of years back. It is our path, our way of seeing the world, our consolation and salvation. Multiple functions and essential to Ayurveda.”<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj had a gift for rumbling on, deaf to any interruptions, as though no one else present had anything worthwhile to say—which, Audie reflected, was probably so, since neither he nor Beth had much to add. Beth was intent now on one of Dr. Nagaraj’s stories.<br><br>“Elephants,” he was saying, “bearing down on my friend Sanjeev.”<br><br>Hadn’t he told this story before?<br><br>“But Sanjeev could not swim. He sank to his knees, as big bull elephant approached. And elephant, too, fell to his knees and enclosed poor Sanjeev between his great tusks.”<br><br>“And protected him from the other elephants,” Beth said.<br><br>“In beginning, yes, protection was there. Tusks were there,” Dr. Nagaraj said. “But elephant rose to his feet and withdrew. Sanjeev remained on his knees, head down. When coast was clear, I went down and found that my friend was dead.”<br><br>Surely this was the same story, with a different ending?<br><br>“He had not been crushed,” Dr. Nagaraj said. “He somehow died of heart failure. I could not help him, yet I had brought the poor man to this place. Of course, I was devastated.”<br><br>“Did he have a family?”<br><br>“No wife, no children. But parents are there.”<br><br>“Life’s so short,” Beth said.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj smiled. “No, no. Life continues. It flows. There is no end.”<br><br>The next day, Dr. Nagaraj left a message tucked under their door, requesting a meeting at one o’clock in his office. He had never written to them before; his handwriting was severe and intimidating, and one was their lunch hour.<br><br>“What’s this all about?” Audie asked.<br><br>They met him together, feeling importuned, then sheepish when it turned out that Dr. Nagaraj was only being helpful. Somehow he had discovered that Beth had been looking to buy a shahtoosh, perhaps more than one. Dr. Nagaraj said that he knew a certain man, but that it was not possible for this shahtoosh seller to enter Agni. It was not permitted.<br><br>“He is just a common hawker, you see. From the town.”<br><br>“The town we keep hearing about,” Beth said.<br><br>“Hanuman Nagar,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>“How will we get there?”<br><br>“I will request a vehicle—a motorcar.”<br><br>They met the car not in the circular drive but in a more circumspect way, at the Agni entrance. The old-fashioned white sedan was waiting, curtains on its windows, tassels dangling from the curtains. The Blundens got into the back seat, Dr. Nagaraj in the front with the driver, and they left Agni for only the second time in more than three weeks.<br><br>The road levelled off at a fork, the wider path continuing to descend, a narrower one traversing the slope. The car turned onto this narrower road, into the glaring afternoon sun, which dazzled them. They averted their eyes until they were in shadow again, the shadow of a row of roadside huts and shops, where there were plodding cows and two boys kicking a dusty blue ball.<br><br>This was the talked-about town, the town they had smelled and heard, the town of the smoke. And now that they were in it they could match the sounds to their sources—not just the laboring buses and trucks but the wailing of music, shrieking songs.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj said nothing. The Blun-dens sat horrified, as they had been on the way from the airport, at the squalor, the crowds of people. They drew level with a bus stop where a rusty Tata bus was letting off passengers.<br><br>“What’s that?” Beth asked.<br><br>Up ahead there was a pile of soot-blackened rubble inside the sort of walled courtyard she associated with holy places and private villas.<br><br>“Shrine,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>“Are they tearing it down?”<br><br>“No. Building it up. Formerly it was mosque. Before mosque it was Hindu temple. Back to Hindu temple now.”<br><br>Smoke swirled behind the fortified gates.<br><br>“Who are those people?”<br><br>“*Yatris*. Pilgrims. Holy people. They are venerating the site. Also some people protecting the site.”<br><br>“Protecting it against whom?”<br><br>“*Goondas*. Rascals, and Muslims.”<br><br>Now they could see occupiers and protesters, both sides carrying signs, all of them shouting.<br><br>“How can you tell they’re Muslims?”<br><br>“Beards are there.”<br><br>“Is this a problem?”<br><br>“It is situation,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>“What if it gets out of hand?”<br><br>“Not possible. Although this is a Muslim area, so to say, Muslim people are outnumbered in this town. This is historic town. This town is mentioned favorably in Atharvaveda. This is Hanuman town, where he seized mountain of medicinal herbals to heal the sickly Lakshman.”<br><br>As he lectured them, Beth saw that a detachment of uniformed policemen had lined up and were holding four-foot sticks against a crowd of men—the men who were shouting and shaking their fists at another group of men inside the enclosure, where a bonfire blazed.<br><br>“I think I mentioned how I led my friend among the elephants,” Dr. Nagaraj said, hardly seeming to notice the people peering into the car, the motorcycles and handcarts vying for space on the road, or their own furiously honking driver.<br><br>“I seem to recall it,” Audie said.<br><br>Beth was only half listening. She could feel the tension of the town in her body like a cramp; she could smell it and taste it. It was dreadful and disorderly, yet she was roused by its truth, as if by the revelation of something that had been hidden from her. It was India with the gilt scraped off, hungry India, the India of struggle, India at odds with itself.<br><br>“I was devastated,” Dr. Nagaraj said. He was still talking about his friend, dead among the elephants. “I could not stop sobbing at his funeral.”<br><br>They had come to the shop. Beth could see the stack of shahtooshes on the counter, the welcoming shopkeeper pushing people aside so that they could alight. They entered the shop and were shown to plastic chairs. The shopkeeper then pulled a wooden shutter closed, as though to conceal the transaction. With some ceremony, he unfolded a shahtoosh and presented it to Beth to admire. Before she could register her pleasure, he gave her another one.<br><br>“His grandmother took me aside. She said, ‘Do you know the story of Vishnu, who rode on the great bird Garuda to the House of the Gods?’ ”<br><br>“Feel—*chiru*,” the shahtoosh seller was saying, unfolding one piece after another, draping some of them on the counter and thrusting others into Beth’s hands.<br><br>“ ‘As Vishnu and Garuda entered the House of the Gods they saw a small bird at the gateway. The Lord of Death also entered, and he smiled at the little bird. Garuda was so shocked at this he seized the little bird in his beak and took him fifty kilometres away, to save him from the Lord of Death.’ And by the way,” Dr. Nagaraj said, “these are first-quality shahtoosh. Made from chin hairs of very rare Tibetan antelope. Woven in Kashmir.”<br><br>Audie said, “Is that the end of the story? The little bird was saved?”<br><br>In their experience, Dr. Nagaraj never said yes or no. He considered Audie’s question and said, “When ultimately they left the House of the Gods, Vishnu said, ‘Where is the little bird?’ ”<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj had turned his back to the Blundens and was speaking into the shadows of the shop, where a naked child was slapping the tiles with a plastic cup.<br><br>“Before Garuda could reply, Lord of Death said, ‘I smiled to see little bird here, because he was supposed to be fifty kilometres away, to meet his death.’ ”<br><br>Hearing this, Beth was stricken, as though Dr. Nagaraj had pinched her, and without thinking she said, “We must be going.” She was overcome by the mustiness of the shop, the incense that seemed a mingling of perfume and cow shit, the imploring shahtoosh seller, and, within earshot, the yells of the men at the shrine. She picked up two scarves and said, “I’ll take these two.”<br><br>“I told him you are not tourists, you are *yatris* yourselves, doing *puja* at Agni.”<br><br>“That’s us,” Audie said.<br><br>“I will deal with money. You know it is some thousands of dollars?” Dr. Na-garaj said. “You can pay me later. I will find you in the car.”<br><br>They made their way to the car through the crowd that had gathered to gape at them. Dr. Nagaraj got into the front seat and they were soon driving back up the main street of the cracked and littered town.<br><br>“How long has this mob scene been going on?” Audie asked.<br><br>“Some years now.”<br><br>Audie inquired in a reasonable voice, “Would you mind explaining your story? Maybe I’m stupid, but I don’t get it.”<br><br>“Listen, my friend. Grandmother of Sanjeev said to me, ‘Don’t be sad. Garuda guided the little bird to his death unknowingly, as you guided Sanjeev. You were *meant* to deliver him.’ ”<br><br>They continued the rest of the way to Agni in silence. Then, as the car slowed at the gate, Dr. Nagaraj began speaking again. “ ‘Maybe this is your purpose in world,’ she said. ‘To guide people to their fate. You are vehicle.’ ”<br><br>On the way to the lodge, Audie asked the cost of the scarves. Dr. Nagaraj seemed relieved, and smiled as the money was counted into his hand.<br><br>“A great bargain, sir. And you are so lucky. This antelope is almost extinct.”<br><br>“Amazing story, eh?” Audie said, once they were back in their room.<br><br>She stared at him.<br><br>“About that guy Sanjeev. The Lord of Death. Kind of an ‘Appointment in Samarra’ thing.”<br><br>Beth said, “I didn’t know what he was talking about. Anyway, didn’t you say he was a quack?”<br><br>“I like that he could talk a dog off a meat wagon,” Audie said. “And I sometimes think I’m a quack, a phony.”<br><br>She stared at him again, distancing herself with a smile.<br><br>He said, “Don’t you ever think that?”<br><br>“About you?”<br><br>“About yourself.” Normally he became hot and impatient when he had to clarify something obvious to her, but he wasn’t impatient now; he was sympathetic and mild.<br><br>“No,” she said.<br><br>Now it was early afternoon. She was reading by the pool, on the platform under the trees, hidden by a hedge from anyone who happened to be in the chaise longues—but there was no one there, or in the pool. Audie was at a treatment. She had ordered a lemonade and a grilled-vegetable sandwich, but had only sipped at the drink.<br><br>With a thump, something landed behind her, the sandwich was snatched, and she flinched, raising her arms, and saw a monkey bound away. In her instant memory it was a monkey, but, at the moment of muddled confrontation, she had glimpsed the thing as a hairy, hostile child, and she was too panicked to scream.<br><br>After leaping into the biggest of the trees, the monkey found a branch, grasped it with his feet, and began to gnaw at the sandwich, scattering vegetables. These were seized by other monkeys, maybe a dozen, big and small, more insolent than afraid, with a malevolent patience, a defiance that she identified—just a hunch, something about the set of their jaws, the biting faces—as the courage of hunger.<br><br>They moved toward her without a sound, scarcely seeming to touch the deck boards in their tumbling, noiseless flowing, their faces twitching. She opened her mouth to shout but could not make a sound.<br><br>Their hair prickled on her body, scraped at her legs. They grabbed more of the loose vegetables that were lying on the deck, poked them into their mouths, yet kept their eyes on her. She felt that they wanted to eat her face, push her legs apart, squat on her breasts and stink.<br><br>She covered her face with one arm, flung her other arm across her breasts, and went numb from the waist down, as if in a dream where she found her legs crippled.<br><br>Then there was the crack of something landing in their midst—a heavy clattering stick—and the monkeys fell back. Then another stick with a thump as a man hurried past Beth, shouting, “Shoo! Shoo!” Holding his sandals in his hands, the man waved his arms, still shouting, physically thrusting the creatures away, into the trees, finally picking up the sticks he had thrown and flinging them again, until at last the monkeys were out of sight.<br><br>“Don’t worry, Madam,” the man said, turning to her. He was young, hardly a man, in white pants and a white smock. He looked beautiful. “They are very bold,” he said. He retrieved his sandals and slipped them on. He was smiling—lovely teeth, great confidence, not fazed at all. Audie would have been gasping.<br><br>She made a grateful sound, meant to be “Thank you,” but it was just a nervous exhalation.<br><br>“You see, they have been around humans for so long they have lost their fear. They are used to being fed by hand, at the temple in town—they are like little gods, spoiled children, you can say. Are you all right, Madam?”<br><br>“Where did you come from?” Beth said, with difficulty.<br><br>“Hanuman Nagar.”<br><br>“No, no,” she said. She rephrased the question. “Were you watching them?”<br><br>“I was watching you, Madam.”<br><br>He faced her squarely, not smiling, looking intently at her.<br><br>“Thank you.”<br><br>He did not blink. He said, “Since you arrived at Agni, I have not stopped watching you.”<br><br>That made her pause; she was at a loss to reply. “I don’t know how to thank you,” she said. “Please take this,” and she reached into her bag by the chair and took out some rupees. They felt like cloth in her hand they were so worn.<br><br>“Oh, no, Madam,” the young man said, and put his hands behind his back in a prim gesture.<br><br>“Isn’t there anything?”<br><br>“Yes.” He was quick—already he had control of the situation. “You can request me.”<br><br>“Request you?”<br><br>“For treatment,” he said. “Ask for Satish.”<br><br>The slow drip of hot oil on Audie’s back, the pressure and heat, suggested her fingertips, and when she drizzled the oil in widening circles it was as though she were caressing him. She did not say much, hardly spoke unless he asked a direct question. Yet the confident intelligence in her hands moved down his back, a wise inquiry in the motion of her fingers. She was able by touching him to find parts of his body that, until that moment, were unknown to him. Her insinuating hands awakened a knotted muscle, rested on it, and pushed, giving it life.<br><br>“That’s nice.”<br><br>Anna paired her thumbs and pushed again.<br><br>“You are having this in America, sir?”<br><br>“Doubt it.”<br><br>She went silent. Perhaps she hadn’t understood his grunt. She worked harder still on the muscles next to his spine.<br><br>“I would like to go to America. Where is your home, sir?”<br><br>He did not say, as he usually did, “That’s a hard question. We’ve got a place in Florida, an apartment in New York, a house in Maine . . .”<br><br>“I’m from Boston,” he said. “Near Boston.”<br><br>“Boston Tea Party. Boston Red Sox. Boston beans.”<br><br>He laughed into his towel, then raised his head and asked, “Ever been outside of India?”<br><br>“Only to Delhi, sir. School trip, sir.”<br><br>That reminded him of how young she was. He said, “You could probably make a lot of money in the States. Doing massages.”<br><br>“But also to meet people, sir. To be happy, sir. To be free, sir.”<br><br>“You’re free here, aren’t you?”<br><br>“No, sir. Not free. It is very hard here for me. As I mentioned, I am Christian, sir.”<br><br>She was now working on his right arm. She had begun on his shoulder, squeezed and pressed her way to his wrist and was massaging his palm and, one by one, his fingers. Her manipulating his fingers he found like an act of the purest friendship, more sensual, more intimate, as she pushed and pulled, than her touch on any other part of his body. Take my hand, he thought. It meant everything.<br><br>“Wouldn’t you be afraid to be in the United States alone?”<br><br>The way she touched him told him that she was thinking. “Maybe I will find someone to look after me.”<br><br>“Give you money, you mean?”<br><br>“I will earn it, sir.”<br><br>He asked, “What would you do?”<br><br>“I can do so many things, sir.”<br><br>“What makes you so sure?”<br><br>“I have training, sir.”<br><br>“Lots of girls have training.”<br><br>“But my training, sir, is not in school.”<br><br>“Experience?”<br><br>“Yes, sir. Best teacher, sir.”<br><br>She caught his fingers and brushed them against her body, he could not tell where, perhaps her breast or her smooth cheek.<br><br>He was aware that he had had this conversation many times in his life, the flirting, the allusion, the euphemism, in his earliest talks with girls, as a boy of twelve or thirteen, and almost fifty years on, the same innuendo, the same themes—the language of suggestion, never quite coming to the point yet always knowing what the point was. He delighted in this inexplicit talk.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>“Yup?”<br><br>“Please turn over, sir.”<br><br>“Not just now.”<br><br>She sighed in approval. She knew that he was aroused and embarrassed. He could not turn over without exposing himself, bulging against the covering.<br><br>“That is all right, sir.” She was trying to be serious.<br><br>“Give me a minute. I’m happy.”<br><br>“I want to please you, sir.”<br><br>“You’re doing fine.”<br><br>“Thank you, sir.” She leaned against his back, as though embracing him, but using her elbow, her forearm, her fists on his packed muscles. When he was facing away from her, she seemed bolder.<br><br>“Did you learn that in school?”<br><br>She did not hesitate, she pressed harder, her whole body upon him.<br><br>“No, sir.” He could tell she was smiling. “In life, sir.”<br><br>For a few days, Audie and Beth found reasons to be busy, to remain apart at the very times when, a week earlier, they would have been punctually together, at the pool, in the restaurant, in their suite, at yoga, awaiting a treatment, poking golf balls across the putting green, side by side.<br><br>Now, “I guess I just missed you,” Beth would say, as a way of explaining her all-afternoon absence.<br><br>“That’s O.K.,” Audie would reply. “I was tied up longer than I’d expected.”<br><br>Each was grateful for the other’s casualness; the fact that they did not need to explain their absences to each other kept them ambiguous, almost without meaning, as they’d been over the years when, late coming home from the office, Audie had said, “I was held up.” On many of those occasions he’d been with a woman—his secretary, or someone from the company, or the wife of an employee.<br><br>Beth, in her absences, which were mostly for treatments, wanted to be touched. And in the hours in between she needed to be alone, to reflect on being touched, held, caressed, and whispered to, even if the words were only “Please relax your arm” or “Please turn over for me” or “Is it too hard, Madam?”<br><br>She found that she could not pass easily from the intimacy of the treatment room to a meal or a drink with Audie. With Audie, she would have felt vulnerable and slightly ridiculous. But when she was alone there was something delicious in her reverie—no one to judge it, nothing to measure it by. It was almost like the fantasy of a virgin.<br><br>Still, she did nothing to encourage Satish—in fact, she resisted him. With the sort of impatient clumsiness that he’d used against the wild monkeys, he offered her all sorts of invitations. First, she pretended not to understand, then she flatly refused. Yet why did even her refusals make her flush with guilt? Perhaps because she had never before kept a secret from Audie? And none of her refusals had been so strong as to discourage the boy. As the days passed, Satish became more familiar, which was his way of being persistent.<br><br>One day, as she stood in her robe before a massage, the blinds half drawn, he raised his hands and said, “Moment, Madam.”<br><br>Satish assumed the lotus position, and then, twining his legs and falling backward, hauled himself up in a series of specific but fluid moves, tipped forward onto his forearms, supporting his head and whole body, and raised his legs until they were vertical. Finally, he lowered his legs over his back and lifted his neck, so that his feet touched his face.<br><br>“*Vrischikasana*,” he grunted through his wiggling toes.<br><br>“I’ve seen that in circuses,” Beth said.<br><br>“Scorpion pose.”<br><br>He was, she realized, trying to impress her, and his effort made her smile.<br><br>“You see this watch?” he said another day.<br><br>She looked, but she could not tell the make; it was plump, and it seemed absurdly technical.<br><br>“Chronometer,” he said, pressing the protrusions at its edges. “Timer, digital readout. Twistable bezel. Totally waterproof. Immersible for two hundred metres. Self-winding.”<br><br>“I thought it was a bracelet.”<br><br>“Is also jewelry. Valuable!”<br><br>“You’re not supposed to wear that when you do massages, are you?” Beth took him by the hand and turned his wrist over and squeezed the watchband, plucking open its fastener, slipping it off. “Isn’t that better?” She had touched him for the first time.<br><br>He looked chastened as he ducked outside to allow her the privacy to slide beneath the sheet on the massage table. But in the half-dark of the room, on his return, he was confident again, working on her shoulders, breathing softly against her neck.<br><br>“Have a nice night,” he said to her when the massage ended.<br><br>It seemed like an inquiry. She said, “What do you do at night?”<br><br>“I repair to my house. Reading to improve education. Yoga to improve body and mind. Also painting.”<br><br>“You paint pictures?”<br><br>“Classical painting,” he said. “Indian gods and goddesses.”<br><br>What made her feel awkward was that she knew, before he said another word, where this entire conversation was going, the next elements of it, her questions, his responses, and how in a matter of minutes it would end. And she had started it.<br><br>“Lovely,” she found herself saying. “It sounds lovely.”<br><br>“Painting with brush. Making pictures for *puja*.” He wobbled his head, a misleading movement she now understood as affirmative.<br><br>“You’re a man of many talents.”<br><br>She was glad that no one could hear these predictable phrases and clichés. It was as though she were reciting dialogue that someone else had prepared for her. Perhaps all love affairs began like this, as repetition, as mimicry. Yet she wanted to believe that the feeling was real and originated within her.<br><br>It was better not to say anything, better just to smile, to give nothing a name. In spite of this, another line came to her. “I’d like to see them.”<br><br>“Yes, please.”<br><br>“Maybe sometime.”<br><br>“Madam, tonight.”<br><br>Against her will, she found herself agreeing, and afterward, avoiding Audie at the pool, she felt excited, thrilled, yet jittery, like a girl.<br><br>Satish had said that he’d meet her below the laundry building, which lay on the path that wound down to the main road into Hanuman Nagar. After dinner, she told Audie that she was going up to the spa, but instead ducked into the bamboo grove and walked quickly through the thick flowering trees into the smoky air that rose from the town.<br><br>A person thrusting a broomstick at her rose up on the road and caused her to gasp.<br><br>“Madam.”<br><br>“Who are you?”<br><br>“*Chowkidar*, Madam.”<br><br>“What do you want?”<br><br>Fright made her severe, and her severity made the man deferential.<br><br>He said, “Protection only, Madam.”<br><br>His mildness calmed her. She found some rupees in her pocket—in the darkness she could not tell how much—and handed the notes to the watchman. He touched them to his forehead and bowed to let her pass.<br><br>The downward path was so narrow that her shoulders brushed the bushes on either side. The sense that she was leaving one world for another was palpable. Where she’d thought she saw a monkey squatting on its heels, a man stood up. She was too startled to scream; her hands flew up to protect her face. Then she saw that it was Satish.<br><br>“Not to worry,” he said.<br><br>Rattled, she said, “I can’t stay long.”<br><br>“It is near,” he said, placing a finger on her elbow to steer her, and when she reacted he said, “Sorry!”<br><br>His touch made her stumble, the path here littered with loose stones. He was still apologizing as they passed behind a shop, a wall that reeked of urine, and came out onto the road. In the distance, she saw the shopfronts of Hanuman Nagar, merchandise hanging in doorways, and the fires at the monkey temple—men waving torches, chanting, the line of policemen holding sticks.<br><br>“Cart Road,” Satish said, blocking her way as a truck went slowly past in gusts of diesel fumes.<br><br>She followed him, her head down, walking just above the gutter and the storm drain, thinking, This is insane.<br><br>“I have to go back,” she said, and felt even more like a girl, but a foolish one.<br><br>“It is just here,” he said, fluttering his fingers into the middle distance.<br><br>All she saw were small yellow windows, like lanterns hanging in darkness, faces at some of the windows, and the blue flicker of TV sets. At one doorway, she smelled meat grilling, the sputter and hiss of hot snapping fat.<br><br>Satish must have smelled it, too. He said, “Muslim people. Many here. This we are calling”—he was pointing at Monkey Hill but the sweep of his arm seemed to take in the whole province—“Muslim belt.”<br><br>She said, “I can’t go any farther.”<br><br>“We have arrived,” he said, and led her up a path of broken paving stones, past a small astonished girl in a bright-pink dress dawdling by a lit doorway, past a padlocked shed, to a door latch, which he manipulated, pushing the door open. Beth stepped inside quickly, fearing to be seen, and was at once suffocated by the smell of cooked food, steaming on a low table.<br><br>“Bhaji,” Satish said, lifting the lid of a tin pot. Then more lids up and down, “Mung dhal. Uttapam. Bindi. Naan bread. Rice.”<br><br>“Very nice,” Beth said, overcome by the heat, the stifling aromas, and a distinct smell of turpentine.<br><br>“Curd,” Satish said, offering her a dish of crudded yogurt.<br><br>“I really must go back,” she said.<br><br>“Madam,” he said. “Take some food.”<br><br>“I’m not hungry,” she said, and remembered from a book on India that it was considered offensive to refuse food in an Indian household, but that a small symbolic mouthful was all that was necessary. She said, “But some of that curd would be delicious. Just a touch.”<br><br>He spooned some into a bowl and handed it to her, saying, “Sit, please, Madam. A drink. Hot tea. Juices. Cool water.”<br><br>She was rechecking the position of the door, preparing her exit, when she saw an assortment of foot-high paintings propped on a shelf, under a bare light bulb.<br><br>“No, thank you. Are those your pictures?”<br><br>She was still standing, eying the door. He went to the paintings and selected a highly colored one of a fat naked baby attended by a smiling chubby-cheeked woman in a yellow sari.<br><br>“Bal Krishna,” he said. “Krishna baby. Mother Yashoda.”<br><br>Moving closer to the shelf, she saw other pictures she had taken to be animals, yet some of them had human features in spite of their snouts and multiple arms.<br><br>“Ganesh. Hanuman. Durga. I do with brush. Classical.”<br><br>“Superb. Thank you. Now I must go.”<br><br>But as soon as she turned and found the latch and got the door ajar he was next to her, embracing her, pressing himself against her, whinnying, “Madam. Madam.”<br><br>“I don’t feel at all well,” she said.<br><br>“I have aspirin, Madam.” His hands and fingers flexed on her waist, as though testing its pliability.<br><br>But now she had got the door open, and the night air had a chilly smell of dirt and wood smoke that clung like grime to her face and arms.<br><br>Just a few feet down the path, the small girl in the pink dress gaped. Satish had pursued Beth, but when he saw the little girl he hesitated, seemingly overcome, and dropped his arms to his sides, gathering his hands into his pajama top as though in a reflex of shame.<br><br>Without a word, moving efficiently in fear, Beth stepped along the walkway and fled into the road, keeping her head down when car headlights passed her. She looked back several times, to make sure that she was not being followed.<br><br>She slipped into the suite with the stealth of a burglar, and called out “Audie?” But there was no reply. The suite was empty.<br><br>In the darkness outside the Agni enclosure, the smell was more apparent. Audie had stood there just at nightfall, watching the sun drop as though dissolving into the depths of dust and haze that lay in thick bars above the horizon, obliterating the mountains. Rising around him was the sharp smell of dry trees, the dander of grubby monkey fur, boiled beans, burned meat, foul water, until the darkness itself seemed to stifle him.<br><br>Had Beth not announced that she was getting an evening treatment, he would not have come. But impulsively he had called Anna’s cell phone and, as though expecting his call, she had given him explicit directions. Six-thirty sharp.<br><br>“Excuse me, sir.”<br><br>Her voice came out of the darkness. She was walking toward him, and she emerged as though materializing before him like a phantom.<br><br>“I didn’t see you coming. Don’t you have a flashlight?”<br><br>“A torch, sir, yes. But not necessary now.”<br><br>She did not want to be seen. That was a sign of her seriousness. And Audie summed her up quickly: she is meeting me secretly; she thinks she knows what I want; she is willing to coöperate. All this was obvious in her unwillingness to use a light. Artful, he thought, but even I don’t know what I want.<br><br>“Your cell phone works pretty well on the hill.”<br><br>“My mobile, sir. Guest Services provides. Sometimes we are on call for night treatments.”<br><br>“Is that what this is?”<br><br>Anna laughed, snuffling nervously. “I don’t know, sir.”<br><br>“Where’s your flashlight, honey?”<br><br>“Here, sir.”<br><br>He groped for it, found her warm hand, took the flashlight, and switched it on, hoping that the light would drive away the smell. It seemed to work; as soon as he could see the stony path, he could breathe more easily.<br><br>“Where are we going?”<br><br>“My friend’s flat, sir.”<br><br>“In the woods?”<br><br>“Not woods, sir. Residential Civil Lines.”<br><br>“Where do you live, Anna?”<br><br>“Staff block, sir. Hostel, sir.”<br><br>“You keep saying ‘sir.’ ”<br><br>“Yes, sir,” and she giggled, her hand over her mouth.<br><br>Audie was careful not to touch her, though she was walking just in front of him, on the steep downward path toward the glare of some sulfurous lights. He saw a three-story squarish building, the smell of rotting clothes lingering near it.<br><br>“Is that it?”<br><br>“It is, sir.”<br><br>But he had stopped. He’d lost the momentum he’d had in the darkness on the path above.<br><br>“In here, sir.”<br><br>He took a step toward her. He reached and put his arm around her. She was tense. She seemed to quail, holding her face away from him yet presenting her hips. Her bare belly was soft like a cushion of bread dough in his hand. She was breathing hard.<br><br>“Are you all right?”<br><br>“Yes, sir. I am all right, sir.” He could tell that she was willing; he could also tell that she was terrified. “Let we go inside, sir?”<br><br>Audie took a deep breath and, expelling it, slackened his grip on her. Aware that he was still holding her lightly, he became self-conscious and let go. He felt in his pocket for his wallet, which was fat with rupees, and without looking at the denominations—he carried only five-hundred-rupee notes—he took out a thickness of them and pressed them into her hand.<br><br>“This is for you.”<br><br>“Thank you, sir.”<br><br>Not only did she accept the money, she seemed relieved. Her whole body relaxed.<br><br>“You’re a good girl. I want you to stay that way.”<br><br>“Thank you, sir. Bless you, sir.”<br><br>She giggled a bit, and drew another deep breath as she watched him back away up the path.<br><br>Beth was in the room when Audie returned. He was so sheepish from his errand that he did not notice how Beth held her book to shield her face—did not see her apprehension, he was himself so apprehensive.<br><br>“I wasn’t very hungry,” he said.<br><br>“I just had a snack.”<br><br>“Love ya,” he said.<br><br>Waiting in the woods, standing in the darkness had tired him; walking all that way down the path to the isolated apartment block had exhausted him, too. And he was ashamed of himself—of the power he had had over the girl. She had been afraid. He hated himself for having put her in that position, obviously hor-rified at the prospect of sex yet willing to sacrifice herself for the money. In his exhaustion, he fell asleep, his mouth open, his harsh breath rising and falling.<br><br>He did not hear Beth slip out of her bed and dress quickly, did not hear the door click shut.<br><br>Beth hurried to the stairwell, moving carefully, out the front door, past the porte cochere, and across the night-damp lawn to the grove of bamboos. Guided by the risen moon, she found the path to the laundry, and behind it the path to Hanuman Nagar.<br><br>“Madam! *Chowkidar*, Madam.”<br><br>The night watchman was on his feet, saluting with one hand, his flashlight in the other showing her the way.<br><br>Everything seemed easier now that it was an exercise of her will and not a stumbling in the darkness. The downward path lit by the fluorescence of the moon seemed much shorter, and ahead the main street of the town was empty. Two or three men hunkered on their heels, warming their hands at a flaring brazier; some others she passed slept on the sagging rope beds they’d been squatting on earlier in the evening. The temple at the curve in the road was silent, just a few torches burning.<br><br>She found the alley, stepped over the monsoon drain, smiled at the doorway where the little girl had been and was no more, and at the latched door in the whitewashed wall she tapped lightly.<br><br>A murmur came from inside, a word—but not an English word. She was aware of the twitching of curtains at the window. Then the sliding of a rusty bolt, the now familiar smell of food.<br><br>“Oh, thank you,” he said.<br><br>They were up early for yoga, seated on their mats in the pavilion before anyone else arrived. Their eyes were closed, they were listening to the slight breeze brushing at the willows, the twitter of birds, distant voices, feeling—as Vikram urged every morning—the peaceful vibrations.<br><br>Hearing “*Namaskar*,” they opened their eyes and saw that without their realizing it—for no one had spoken—the rest of the yoga class had gathered in the pavilion, eyes closed, waiting to begin.<br><br>“This *asana* is good for blood circulation,” Vikram said. “For back. For bowels. *Tadasana*. Mountain.”<br><br>As Beth elongated her body, reaching upward, her mind was travelling backward. Satish had held her tightly, even after she’d said, “I’m not going anywhere.” He was repeating, “Thank you, thank you,” and then he had led her somewhat roughly—perhaps it was just his impatience—to the corner of the room, onto the mat, and was pushing at her clothes and seeming to sob with urgency.<br><br>She had been at a loss—had no idea what was expected of her, was relieved simply to allow him to lift her clothes, to stroke her body, was even prepared to say, “Take me.” But in his frenzy any talk was unnecessary. After fumbling with her clothes—it was as though he’d never touched buttons before—he’d snatched them off her and knelt to embrace her. She was surprised by his furious impatience.<br><br>“And down for crocodile posture,” the yoga instructor was saying.<br><br>He had lain upon her just like this, lengthwise, his whole weight pressing her, one knee forcing her legs apart. His jaw was clenched, he was fierce, his breath sucked between his teeth.<br><br>“I am bad, I am vicious,” he said, still sucking his breath. “I love you.”<br><br>She twisted under him, feeling the bumping of his hips, and wanted to say, It hurts.<br><br>Afterward, he had said, “Sorry, Madam,” and rolled to the side, leaving her naked and unsatisfied and assaulted—chafed and subtly bruised. But when she looked over at him his hands were covering his face and she felt sorry for him in his shame. He had all at once deflated.<br><br>At the door he had said, “What about present, Madam? Some few rupees?”<br><br>The encounter—briefer than she’d expected, one-sided, like a humiliating shove or a mild spanking—had left her lucid and a bit rueful. It had not been an act of possession—more one of rejection.<br><br>“Haven’t I just given you something?” she said.<br><br>His voice going smoky and dark, he said, “I will see you tomorrow.”<br><br>“Now, for rest, *savasana*,” Vikram said. “Corpse pose.”<br><br>They breakfasted as usual, choosing the Indian option, filling their plates with beans and curried vegetables and yogurt while the waiters held the lids of the tureens open.<br><br>Instead of becoming more familiar, friendlier, Indians became more formal, more solemn, like foot soldiers facing generals. Or was that just here at Agni?<br><br>“As you wish, Madam,” one of the waiters said, bowing, in response to a request for more tea.<br><br>“It is my pleasure,” another one said to Audie.<br><br>“They make you feel important,” Audie said, yet he also sensed more distance than warmth in the politeness, and no one was smiling. “You going for a treatment?”<br><br>“I think I’ll pass.”<br><br>But Audie was eager—most of all eager to see what sort of reception he’d get from Anna, who owed him, he felt, unlimited gratitude. For hadn’t he let her off the hook? He wanted to experience her grateful hands.<br><br>At the spa lobby, three of the staff, like male nurses in white uniforms, stood to attention as Audie approached. Audie smiled, thinking that if they had been wearing shoes instead of sandals their heels would have clicked.<br><br>“I’m here for my treatment.”<br><br>“Have you booked, sir?”<br><br>“I’ll take anything you’ve got.”<br><br>“Nothing available, sir.”<br><br>What struck Audie was that the young man had not even glanced at the thick bound appointment book that lay open on the desk.<br><br>“What do you mean, nothing?”<br><br>“Nothing, sir.”<br><br>He said, “Anna—is she free?”<br><br>“Not here, sir.”<br><br>“When will she get here?”<br><br>“Not at all. Not employed here anymore, sir.”<br><br>Only this one man had done the talking—stonewalling was more like it. Audie sensed that the other two were watching closely for his reaction, but he did not smile until he turned away, thinking, That’s it—take the money and run.<br><br>Later in the morning, Beth, curious about the route she’d taken the previous night, proud of her initiative (two times down the path to Hanuman Nagar: when in her life had she ever struck out alone like that?), wandered through the bamboo grove and the trees above the laundry, just to see where she’d been. Pretending to admire the jasmine that edged the walk, she worked her way to the path and saw the raw wood of a new fence, with a gate crudely wired to it.<br><br>“No entry, Madam.”<br><br>A man in the khaki uniform of the grounds staff stepped from behind a bush to block her way. He held a shiny truncheon.<br><br>“I was just looking.”<br><br>“Needing chit for passage. Having chit, Madam?”<br><br>“Who are you?”<br><br>“*Chowkidar*, Madam.”<br><br>“This fence wasn’t here yesterday.”<br><br>“No, Madam. Put up today morning.”<br><br>Testing him, she said, “What if I want to go to the laundry?”<br><br>“Not available.” The man, still holding his truncheon, folded his arms over his chest.<br><br>She could see that the watchman was adamant, that her arguing with him would only give him a greater victory, something he clearly relished.<br><br>On her way back to the pool, rattled by the encounter, she passed the spa. Instead of the usual boy who received guests for treatments, she saw three men dressed in white, standing like sentries. Noticing her, one of them came to the door.<br><br>“Yes, Madam?”<br><br>Beth smiled. “Lovely day, isn’t it?”<br><br>“You have booking for treatment?” He hadn’t smiled back.<br><br>“Not today.” She peered behind him. “Is that Satish?”<br><br>“No, Madam.”<br><br>“You didn’t even turn around. How are you so sure?”<br><br>“Satish is gone.”<br><br>“What do you mean?”<br><br>“Charge-sheeted, Madam.”<br><br>She smiled again, as though she’d understood. “Actually, I was just going to the pool.”<br><br>Gone? All she could think was that he had somehow slipped away; that he was guilty of some sort of theft. He had asked her for money. Perhaps, with money on his mind, he had stolen something from the spa strongbox. Some guests paid for their treatments in cash; she had seen the stacks of rupees.<br><br>Over lunch, Audie and Beth sat hard-ly speaking, except to remark on the weather, the sun-flecked veranda, the flowering trees, the bolder birds raiding the leftovers at vacated tables.<br><br>The waiters came and went, refilling the water glasses, using tongs to put warm naan into their basket, and finally slipping the check to be signed into a plastic wallet and placing it near Audie’s plate.<br><br>There were some people eating on the veranda whom Beth and Audie had never seen before at lunchtime. The large table near the far rail, for example, was occupied by two men in suits and ties, looking out of place, one of them talking to the manager, a man with an unpronounceable name with whom Audie renewed their booking every week.<br><br>When the waiter approached to pick up the signed lunch check, Audie put his hand over it to detain him.<br><br>“Who’s that?”<br><br>“Mr. Shah, sir. Owner of Agni, sir. And his managing partner. Also, as you know, Mr. Rajagolopalachari, manager.”<br><br>Audie smiled in the direction of the owner, this Mr. Shah, businessman to businessman, wishing for eye contact. But the man was still speaking, waving his hands, tapping on the table with his gold ring for emphasis.<br><br>“Another week, Tugar?” Audie said as they left the restaurant. They walked through the gardens and up the slope to the lobby of the main building to signal their intention to stay on.<br><br>The clerk they spoke to stood up at his desk and faced them. “You must see the manager, sir.”<br><br>“He’s at the restaurant,” Audie said.<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>“So what do we do?”<br><br>“Come back later, sir.”<br><br>They had a nap by the pool, in the shade of the overhanging trees, and at four, yawning, they made their way back up the slope.<br><br>A man they had never seen before met them on the stairs of the main building, greeting them but also obstructing their way.<br><br>“You’re not the manager,” Audie said.<br><br>“Acting manager.”<br><br>“Where’s the manager?”<br><br>“He has been put on indefinite leave,” the man said. “How may I help you?”<br><br>“It’s just, here we are again. We’re staying another week.”<br><br>The man’s mouth tightened. He said, “Sorry, sir.”<br><br>Audie said, “What do you mean?”<br><br>“Fully booked, sir. From tomorrow, sir.”<br><br>“We’ve been doing this week to week. We’ve never had a problem. You can fix us up.”<br><br>Beth added, “We’ll take whatever you’ve got.”<br><br>“Nothing available, sir.” The man had begun to smile, which made his intransigence all the more baffling.<br><br>“The place is practically empty,” Audie said.<br><br>“Departure tomorrow morning-time is eleven, sir. Bags will be picked up. Car will be waiting. Settle bill, sir. Paperwork, sir. All charges to date.”<br><br>“You mean now?”<br><br>“If you please.”<br><br>Audie handed over his credit card, and then sat with Beth in the garden, listening to the musicians who were playing in an open pavilion. Above the music, they heard loud voices, scolding, possibly the owner’s voice—it was a tone they had never heard before at peaceful Agni. There were the sounds of scurrying, the whirr of golf carts coming and going, the important slamming of car doors. There was a suggestion of turbulence, turmoil, the sort of thing they’d seen in the lower world of Hanuman Nagar, but not here.<br><br>“Someone’s getting his nose bitten off,” Audie said. “Glad it’s not me.”<br><br>They skipped dinner and went to bed early—too early, perhaps, because neither of them could sleep. Beth kept seeing Satish’s toothy face saying, “I will see you tomorrow,” and now it sounded like a threat. Audie wondered what Anna was going to do with the money and regretted having given her so much. He had made that mistake before. They lay wakeful, face-saving in their separate beds, too chagrined to confide their feelings—yet they knew, without conferring, that they had been rebuffed. “Nothing available” was a lie, one of those obvious lies intended to humiliate you. Still, they were not so sorry to leave. It was India, after all, and they were headed home.<br><br>The morning was smokier than usual. A haze hung over Agni, seeming to rise from the town. They had expected one of the white Mercedeses from the Agni fleet to be waiting at the entrance, but saw instead a tubby black Ambassador parked in the porte cochere. The car’s hood was secured with a piece of rope that dangled over the radiator grille. No driver in sight. They were used to a sendoff from luxury hotels. *Please do come back and see us again.* But here there was nothing.<br><br>As Audie began to complain, he heard Beth say, “Hello, stranger,” in a grateful way.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj had approached the car and was opening doors for them. Now Audie noticed that the car had side curtains, a flourish that made it look older and somehow grubbier.<br><br>“My vehicle,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>“You’re taking us?”<br><br>“Why not?”<br><br>“Where’s the driver?”<br><br>“Not available.”<br><br>Yesterday’s lame excuse. And though Beth had already got into the back seat, Audie was puzzled. “I don’t get it. Why no drivers?”<br><br>“They are lodging complaints about road conditions.”<br><br>All these uncoöperative people and the sense of being banished made Audie cross; he showed it by seating himself next to Beth and slamming the door.<br><br>“I will drive you to the airport for the first Mumbai flight,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>They could see from the way he clutched the steering wheel and labored with his forearms that he was a terrible driver, stamping on the brake, thumping the clutch, and mashing the gears. Audie mumbled, “Grind me a pound.”<br><br>“Anyway, what’s wrong with the road condition?” he said, louder.<br><br>“Main road is closed,” Dr. Nagaraj said, riding the brake. “Blockage and stoppage. *Rasta roko*, we say.”<br><br>“Is that unusual?”<br><br>“It is usual. People are angry because of Hanuman temple. Muslim people. That is the snag. The blockage is on the main road.”<br><br>“Which way will you go?”<br><br>They were approaching the junction where the main road continued downhill and the road to Hanuman Nagar turned to the right, levelling off.<br><br>“Just here. Cart Road.”<br><br>Beth recognized the name. “That’s the road that goes past the temple. If there’s a mob there, won’t it be dangerous?”<br><br>“I will guide you,” Dr. Nagaraj said.<br><br>Audie smiled at Beth and said, “Tu-gar, you actually know the name of this road?”<br><br>As he spoke, the road constricted and India seemed to shrivel around them, the stony slopes rushing up to the windows of the car, not just a pair of stray cows and the poorer shops at the edge of the town but a family of monkeys looking up from where they were picking through a garbage pile. This sense of walls closing in was made weirder by the absence of any people—not a single soul on a road that had been crowded with bikes and buses the last time they’d been on it, heading to the shahtoosh seller.<br><br>“Where is everybody?”<br><br>This empty road in India had the familiar desolation of a road in an absurd dream from which you woke up sweating.<br><br>Dr. Nagaraj, snatching at the steering wheel, rounded a curve, slowing down. A multicolored barrier lay in the distance, a head-high barricade.<br><br>No, it was a solid mass of men jammed together like a wall across the road. They were waving sticks, perhaps shouting, too, but there was no sound. The windows of the car were shut, and what the Blundens saw resembled the India they had seen from the car on their first day. But these men were bearded and angry, and the sunlight made it all much worse.<br><br>“Turn around!” Audie shouted.<br><br>Shocked into his own language, Dr. Nagaraj was yapping with fear. He slowed the car. He struggled with the steering wheel, attempting a U-turn. But the road was too narrow, and seeing that he could go no farther he began to jiggle the loose gearshift. When he looked back to reverse the car, his face was close to the Blundens, gleaming in terror.<br><br>“Get us the hell out of here!”<br><br>“Oh, God.” Dr. Nagaraj winced at the pock-pock of stones hitting the car, the sound on its metal as of teeth and claws. ♦<br><br>
