You wouldn’t catch them doing sports, but you might see a pair of them walking down the shoulder of a county highway in big floppy hats; you might encounter a group out in the woods in summer, casually fording a stream in technical sandals. They had money, which they appeared rarely to spend. Their glasses were likely to have hinged clip-on sunshades attached; the books in their satchels came from the public library. These people had no name. Though they were many in our town, they didn’t self-identify; the idea would have seemed silly to them. But the Breadman brought them together in this otherwise nonwhite, working-class neighborhood every Friday morning. It was the only way to get the bread—or, as my wife liked to call it, the Bread. You had to come here, to this little tchotchke shop that shared an entrance with the children’s used-clothing store, where the Breadman set up his table at precisely ten-thirty—or, rather, half an hour before that, if you wanted to get the focaccia, which couldn’t be reserved beforehand, and was bestowed only upon the prompt. But I’m getting ahead of myself. I wouldn’t have come here on my own in a million, billion years. I liked the bread, but not that much. My wife sent me. She had a cold. That’s why this happened.<br><br>Of course I was late. Which is to say, ten minutes early. There were thirty people in line ahead of me—men and women, but mostly women. Young to middle-aged, but mostly middle-aged. I am middle-aged. But the Breadman’s people had the comfortable, self-possessed air of travellers from some great distance, who had at last arrived at their ultimate destination. They chatted amiably but unostentatiously. They smiled and laughed. None of them looked at their phones. I did, because I was by myself, and because I lived most of my life at a distance from the things and people I loved. It was also a quality of mine that I invariably became the terminus of any queue I joined. I took a photo of the people ahead of me and uploaded it onto the Internet, along with the caption “Standing in the bread line! What is this, Soviet Russia?” A couple of minutes later, I deleted it.<br><br>Pretty soon, the Breadman arrived with his assistants. I’m trying to say that without particular emphasis, because I don’t like the Breadman and want to downplay his star power. But it was quite an entrance. He pulled up to the curb in a red boxlike van that resembled an oven, to gentle applause from the customers. The panel door rolled open, and a couple of stringy, deeply tanned kids in their twenties—a boy and a girl—hopped out and, wearing serious expressions, unloaded the Breadman’s gear: a folding table, a cash box, a stool, several large hinged wicker baskets, a freestanding wooden sign with “*MANNA*{: .small}” painted on it in a bubbly but somehow pedantic script, and then underneath, in precise all-caps sans serif, “*QUALITY BREADS*{: .small}.” The kids made two trips into the tchotchke shop before the Breadman emerged, and when he did, ambling around the snout of the van while distractedly riffling through pages fixed to a clipboard, a chorus of greetings went up from the crowd.<br><br>“Anton! Anton!”<br><br>The Breadman looked up as though surprised. He smiled, gave a little wave. “Hello, everybody! Thank you for coming. We’ll be set up in just a moment.”<br><br>He was my age, but much better-looking and much more at ease in his own skin. That skin was white, of course, which is not to say pale; it was as if he had been brushed with egg white and baked to an even brown. He wore outsized eyeglasses with black plastic frames over vaguely Semitic, bookish features, and his black hair and beard were shaggy and flecked with gray. The gray made him more handsome. His short-sleeved silk shirt was also black, and dusted with flour, as were his tailored jeans. The flour seemed a bit theatrical to me—yes, he was a baker, but were these the clothes he baked in? I suspected it had been sprinkled there intentionally, as a marker of artisanal legitimacy. His feet were bare.<br><br>It was unclear to me why the tchotchke shop had been chosen as the pickup point. It was situated far from where the Breadman’s customers were likely to live, in a neighborhood that, while quite safe by city standards, was nevertheless the staging ground for most of our town’s violent crimes. For that matter, I didn’t know why the tchotchke shop had chosen this location in the first place; I never saw anybody shop there. It seemed to be some kind of craftspeople’s collective, though all the merchandise looked the same—faux-primitive renderings of semirural small-town life on coffee mugs, greeting cards, T-shirts, and, in what could only be seen as a deliberate effort to deter potential buyers, mouse pads. In any event, all of this had now been pushed aside, presumably by the assistants, to accommodate the ingress of the Breadman’s customers. Since I was last in line, I spent the first ten minutes of the selling period in the store’s unventilated glass vestibule, enduring the magnified summer heat.<br><br>I texted my wife: *doors open*.<br><br>*don’t forget the focaccia*, she texted back.<br><br>*that’s a kind of coffee right*, I replied.<br><br>*pls just get it*.<br><br>Looking at that exchange now—I have never deleted a text—I can see that trust was the issue. She didn’t trust me and never had. Which is not to say that I blame anyone but myself for what was to happen.<br><br>I was sweating: marshy pits, swamp ass. The women who had been first in line now edged past me on the way out, keeping as great a distance between us as they could in the elevator-size space, assisted by their giant paper sacks of the Bread, focaccia poking out of the top.<br><br>Chuckles and smiles. “Pardon me.”<br><br>“Pardon *me!*”<br><br>The line accordioned; I emerged into the tchotchke shop. I picked up, fondled, a coffee mug made to resemble a terra-cotta flowerpot. “*TEN SQUARE MILES OF HAPPY!*{: .small}” read a bold legend superimposed above the silhouette of our county. To an outsider, the silhouette wouldn’t look like anything much at all: a chip of old latex paint, a torn postage stamp. But an outsider would never buy this mug, except ironically.<br><br>Now that I was inside, the air-conditioning cooled the sweat patches on my clothes, and I began to shiver. Luckily, there was coffee here, at the front of the line. It came from the coffee shop down the block, and was contained within a mailbox-size waxed-cardboard tote. A stack of paper cups stood beside it, and an aluminum honor box labelled “$1” with a sticky note. Beside that lay an important thing that I had forgotten about: the clipboard. If you wanted the Bread, you had to sign in—specifically, to print your last name and first initial on the neatly hand-ruled table provided. Then you added your signature and your account number. My wife had explained this process to me, and we had rehearsed it together.<br><br>“51093,” I said.<br><br>“Say it again. 51093.”<br><br>“51093.”<br><br>“Just write it down. You’re going to forget it.”<br><br>“51093,” I said. “I don’t need to write it down! 51093.”<br><br>Of course I remember it now, but I didn’t remember it then. I texted her, *account number?*, and then, after a moment’s thought, added, *:) <3*. That done, I left my place in line to pour myself a coffee and check in. The Breadman’s people glared at me as I passed. Why? I was obeying the rules!<br><br>All I had was a five, so I dropped it into the honor box and withdrew three singles. The extra dollar was a tip. Anton himself was now standing six feet to my left, where he was lecturing a zaftig blond woman about spelt. He glanced coolly in my direction at the clank of the honor-box lid but didn’t pause in his monologue.<br><br>I held up the three singles, mouthed the word “change,” and winked.<br><br>As I helped myself to the coffee, my wife’s text came in. *51093*, it read. I dutifully copied this into the appropriate box, along with my wife’s name and initial, and her forged signature. I hazarded another look at the text message. Could a five-digit number read as hostile? Yes, it could. I should call my wife something other than “my wife.” Let’s go with “Kathy,” since that is her real name.<br><br>The Breadman was saying, “It is among the most ancient of grains. At one time it was plentiful in Europe and the Near East, but now it is a relic_t_ crop.” He really leaned on that “t.” I had to look this up later—it’s a word. “Relict,” with a “t” at the end. He said it again. “A relic_t_, though some of us have had success reviving its use in certain enlightened communities. It is also valued as a brewer’s grain.”<br><br>“Fascinating,” the blond woman said.<br><br>“How many focaccia would you like, Angela? One or two?”<br><br>“Two, please.”<br><br>When I returned to the back of the line with my coffee, I discovered that a man had taken my place. He was around seventy years of age, with a long white beard and ponytail, each kept in place by a scrunchie. He held a bicycle helmet in his hands. I considered asking to reassume my rightful place in line, but it didn’t matter, I reasoned. I had signed in first. I wedged myself between him and the door and dispassionately slurped my coffee.<br><br>The old man made no move toward the clipboard, so I said, “You gotta sign in.”<br><br>He seemed not to hear me. He gazed out the window at the slow-moving people and cars.<br><br>“Hey. Sir.”<br><br>He turned.<br><br>“You gonna sign in?” I said. “Pretty sure you have to sign in.”<br><br>The man’s placid, wordless smile served as a dismissal, and he returned to his window-gazing.<br><br>Fine.<br><br>No one else entered behind me as the line slowly diminished. I was not frustrated by the wait: I had my coffee, I had signed in, and I needed only to anticipate receiving the Breadman’s bounty. I didn’t even feel compelled to look at my phone. This way of being was one that Kathy referred to, rather unimaginatively, as “smug mode.” “You just stand there,” she said, “with this incredible air of self-satisfaction, as though all is right in the world and you are majestically enthroned at the center of it.” This characterization was both apt and extremely flattering, though I gather the latter was not her intention.<br><br>It occurred to me, as I observed the Breadman’s languorous, deliberate servicing of his customers, accompanied by the energetic, even frantic, unsmiling efforts of the assistants (removing bread from the baskets, inserting bread into sacks, making change), that the entire operation had been designed first and foremost not as a baked-goods distribution scheme but as a formalized, even ceremonial, vehicle for the expansion and strengthening of Anton’s self-regard. Every aspect of it was obscure. It was a laboratory maze for the Breadman people, a test of their devotion and a method of schooling them in the proper rituals. The odd location; the inconvenient time (which precluded the participation of anyone with a nine-to-five job); the complex, redundant paperwork; the strategic withholding of the one thing that everyone wanted: the Focaccia.<br><br>But I haven’t adequately described the Focaccia. It presented not as a conventional flatbread but as a twelve-inch-diameter half-round, three inches high at the center, tapering to an inch at the edges. Its crust was faintly lambent, aglow with some ineffable crispy glaze, which harbored visibly intact crystals of sea salt and an evidently proprietary blend of coarsely chopped herbs that certainly included rosemary and dill, among less immediately identifiable vegetative bits. The flesh within was richly grained, chewy, and very moist—oily, even—which gave the bread a deep yellow-brown color when toasted. It was not necessary to butter it, it was so rich. But you would have been a fool not to.<br><br>The Focaccia’s crust was crisscrossed with a series of seemingly random slashes that nevertheless interlocked in a complex, snowflake-like pattern. It was only some time later, while walking to an appointment with the woman who prescribes my antidepressants, that I passed a young man wearing a T-shirt bearing the anarchy symbol—the slashed letter “A” inside a rough circle—and it struck me that the pattern on the Focaccia had been composed of the letters “A” and “V,” artfully reiterated: “A” and “V,” as in Anton Vainberg, the Breadman’s full name. I literally jumped as I realized it, startling the punk rocker who’d prompted the revelation, and told my pharmacologist as soon as I entered her office. But she merely nodded, suggested that I save it for my therapist, and cut my dosage, as she had warned me she was planning to do.<br><br>Back in the bread line, I did my best to enjoy my coffee and smug mode, as I listened to the Breadman’s patter with his disciples—gratuitous inquiries into their personal lives, and into the lives of their adult children and pets. “Where’s Boomer today?” “How’s little Pete?” If the follower was a woman alone, the Breadman always asked after the husband or wife or partner, as if to say, “Now, now—I know you want to fuck me, but think of your significant other. How will he or she feel when our affair is discovered?”<br><br>Of course, what everyone really wanted was the Focaccia, two loaves for most. The Focaccia lived in its own special basket, a four-foot rattan cylinder the assistants had to keep leaning farther and farther into, as though into a magic hat for a series of rare and desirable rabbits. I had lost hope—surely it would be gone before I reached the table.<br><br>I wasn’t last in line, though—the old man was. I had to admit to myself, even inside the protective force field of smug mode, that this disparity—between the old man’s correct and actual positions in line—bothered me. And it bothered me more and more as the line diminished. With only a few people remaining, and the Breadman beginning to repeat his monologue about baking times and temperatures, about the burning qualities of various woods and the medicinal properties of certain seeds, I was ejected from smug mode entirely and began to huff and puff and steal glances at my phone. One of the two assistants, the boy, clapped the dust off his hands and walked around behind me to the door, which he locked, presumably to prevent the entry of newcomers. He remained stationed there as a reverse jailer, to allow each customer out once he or she had accepted the Breadman’s largesse. As the last middle-aged couple exited, the boy assistant produced a tight smile that was gone by the time he’d locked the rest of us back in.<br><br>The old man stood at the front of the line now—it was just him, me, and the Manna crew. “Anton,” he said, his voice a dried strap of leather.<br><br>The Breadman’s entire demeanor changed. His shoulders sloped, the haughtiness vanished from his face. He held both hands out, palms up, and the old man took them into his own.<br><br>“Spokefather,” the Breadman said, penitent and husky. He let go of the man’s hands, came around the buffet table, and enveloped him in a brief embrace. The two kissed each other’s cheek.<br><br>The assistants, as though released from a spell by the Breadman’s affection, approached the old man, bowed, and uttered the word that I now understood to be his name.<br><br>“Spokefather.”<br><br>“Spokefather.”<br><br>Conversation was lively, obsequious. The Manna crew inquired about the old man’s “European sojourn,” and his “inner quest,” which may or may not have been the same thing. They asked after “Old Bones,” who, I gathered, was some kind of ailing companion animal.<br><br>“Friends,” the old man said, “how do you roll?”<br><br>“Well, Spokefather. We roll well.”<br><br>And now the old man asked the questions. Anton’s sister: how rolled she? The assistants, did their child thrive? (I hadn’t pegged them as breeders, those two.)<br><br>“She rolls well, Spokefather. Spokefather, the child is strong.”<br><br>For my own part, I felt entirely invisible. These four were locked in some kind of devotional symbiosis—an energy similar to, but more powerful than, that which the Breadman enjoyed with his subjects. Indeed, I wondered if I was observing the conceptual antecedent of the Breadman’s fellowship, the original to which it aspired.<br><br>I briefly forgot why we were all there. Then, with a deep, satisfied sigh, Anton turned and said, “Spokefather, what may I offer you today?”<br><br>“Two focaccia, friend.”<br><br>“Excellent,” the Breadman said, and he bent over the basket, personally withdrew the last two loaves, and slid them carefully into a paper sack while the girl assistant snatched up the empty vessel and whisked it away.<br><br>It took me a moment to absorb what was happening, which left me with little time to compose my objection. Not that more time would necessarily have improved it. I am rhetorically limited even in the most relaxed of circumstances. “Now wait a minute,” I said.<br><br>All heads snapped up. They were clearly surprised to be reminded of my existence.<br><br>“I’m here specifically to buy my wife—my sick wife—some of that focaccia,” I said. “And I was here before this gentleman, and he never signed in.”<br><br>They stared.<br><br>“So those loaves,” I continued, borrowing a phrase from myself, “are rightfully mine to buy.”<br><br>No response.<br><br>“Are they not?” I added.<br><br>The assistants exchanged alarmed glances. The old man appeared beatific—on his face a faint smile emerged, and his eyes fell shut. He tipped his head back, as though in anticipation of instructions from outer space. But he didn’t speak.<br><br>Instead, it was the Breadman who spoke. He said, “Aren’t you Kathy’s?”<br><br>The phrase was like a jolt, an electric shock to my neck and scalp. I must have jerked slightly. I raised my hand to rub the affected area, trying to pass it off as a casual hair-smoothing.<br><br>“I am married to Kathy, yes,” I said. “She asked me to pick up some focaccia.” I pointed at my pocket, which held my phone. That was where Kathy lived, on my phone.<br><br>The Breadman nodded, not at what I said, it seemed, but at some unfathomably complex skein of interlocking events and personalities of which I was, could ever be, only dimly, inadequately aware. He trained a pitying look upon me.<br><br>He said, “Kathy would understand.”<br><br>Before I had a chance to digest this extraordinary remark, the boy assistant stepped up beside me, threateningly close. His face was flushed and slick, and he smelled of sweat and woodsmoke. He said, “The focaccia are for Old Bones.” Then he withdrew to the sidelines, where the mother of his child waited with a comforting half-hug and whispered reassurances.<br><br>“A dog?” I said.<br><br>“Old Bones is Spokefather’s trusted friend,” the Breadman explained. “He’s in his last days now. The focaccia are his favorite treat.”<br><br>I turned to the old man, hoping for some kind of clarification. Surely he wasn’t going to go along with this nonsense? But he was still examining the heavens through the insides of his eyelids and could not be reached.<br><br>“You have a system,” I said. “That’s my understanding. It is very elaborate and highly specific. What’s the point of having a system if somebody can just walk in here, cut in line, and circumvent it? I signed the sheet. I marked my time!”<br><br>The boy assistant snorted and shook his head. The Breadman held out a calming hand, nodded, then pressed his fingertips together. He leaned forward.<br><br>“But this is Spokefather,” he said.<br><br>“I’m sorry,” I replied. “With all due respect. I don’t know who the hell that is. I mean, yes, it’s this guy, but isn’t this a business? Isn’t this a publicly engaged small business? Aren’t I a customer? Aren’t you in the business of selling bread?”<br><br>“We don’t think of it that way,” the girl assistant hissed.<br><br>“It’s all right,” the Breadman said now. “It’s fine. We forgive you for this misunderstanding. But the fact is, you’re here as an agent of Kathy, and Kathy will understand when you tell her that the focaccia went to Spokefather and Old Bones. And her original order,” he went on, “is right here.” He gestured toward a greasy sack standing on the table beside him. “One semolina ciabatta, a seeded eight-grain round, and six cracked-maize dinner rolls. You’ll have all the bread you want. Kathy,” he repeated, “will understand.”<br><br>I should have just taken the bag and paid. But instead I said—shouted, I suppose—“What the hell do you know about Kathy?”<br><br>A silence ensued. The boy assistant’s muscles tensed.<br><br>“We know Kathy very well,” the Breadman finally replied. “We’ve heard about you, too, Samuel. We are friends to your marriage, and to your bodily and spiritual well-being.”<br><br>“The fuck?” was my response.<br><br>“We—all of us—love you, friend.”<br><br>I don’t want to give the impression that I regret my actions, because I do not. These events would prove to be the beginning of a long quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement that continues to this day. I am happier now, back in the city of my origin, with a calmer job and an earnest hope for a more suitable romantic partner, whom I expect to find once I have completed my transformation. No, “completed” is the wrong word: reached, let us say, the next level of my enlightenment. My only wish is that I had spent a few additional seconds plotting my next move, so that I might have enjoyed some small strategic advantage over the Breadman. Instead, I allowed my impulses to rule, and I did what the man expected: I drew my arm back and swung.<br><br>The boy assistant lunged for me, but it wasn’t necessary. Before I had completed my swing, the man they called Spokefather had knocked my feet out from under me with one sweep of his bony ankle, and I pitched helplessly over, driving my face into the corner of the buffet table before arriving at last on the floor. The doctors later told me that I must have struck a loose bit of metal trim, because something thin and sharp had sheared a large flap of skin nearly off my cheek. That’s where all the blood came out. In any event, I declined to tell them how it happened; the police were never summoned, and Kathy’s insurance paid for the emergency treatment. I was later surprised to receive a cleaning bill from the tchotchke shop—the nerve!—but, ultimately, I mastered my fury and paid it.<br><br>I never did go home. Lying there in my hospital bed, pressing an ice pack to my face, I took stock of everything I had observed and put it all together: the sandals, the unbleached fabrics, the unshaved legs and underarms. The rosy skin and the weight gain and the interest in watercolor painting. The jars filled with dried legumes. Soaps with food in them and food with flowers in it. Kathy was Breadman People. She had been for quite a while. She had taken a lover months before (no, not Anton, but one of his followers) and had just been waiting—as her letter on recycled paper eventually told me—for me to notice. My unwillingness to do so had merely reinforced her confidence that she was in the right.<br><br>She was. I am not, and have never been, a cad, but I was a terrible husband. Kathy would have been a fine wife to the appropriate man. Perhaps she is now. I don’t know. I didn’t reply to the letter. Our divorce was amicable and swift, and conducted through intermediaries.<br><br>Of course I can still eat bread. I’m not a child.<br><br>Of course I didn’t learn to bake. Why would I do that? I hate those people and everything they represent.<br><br>Of course I’m not happy. Are you?<br><br>Well, good for you, then.&nbsp;♦<br><br>
