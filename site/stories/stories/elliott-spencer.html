So.<br><br>Soon our Prep is set&emsp;I even have *bathrobe*.<br><br>The door knocks.<br><br>He’s so tired, Meg says to a lady coming&emsp;in with second lady&emsp;with *camera*.<br><br>We may need to keep this brief, says Jer.<br><br>He took a crazy bad beating, Meg says.<br><br>As you saw, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>As all of us saw, Jer says.<br><br>As the whole world saw, Meg says. Nice old guy trying to voice his views, gets his free speech denied?<br><br>What have we come to? says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Just wrong, says Meg.<br><br>Lady: And you folks are?<br><br>Niece, says Meg.<br><br>Niece also, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Nephew, says Jer.<br><br>Lights in my face.<br><br>Blink, blink.<br><br>Lady gives me look of love&emsp;And her voice changes to smooth and sympathy.<br><br>Tell me, Greg, she says. Why, at your age, would you feel compelled to join the protests? When you could be sitting comfortably here in this lovely home, enjoying your retirement, or gardening, if you enjoy gardening, as so many old folks seem to? Not to appear ageist? Or playing cards or watching old movies on TV?<br><br>I care about this country, I say.<br><br>(As Prepped.)<br><br>Jer and Meg and Kennedy&nbsp;B. look at me like: Yes, yes, how well said, by our uncle.<br><br>I believe I should be able to state my views, though old, I say.<br><br>So true, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>So modestly put, says Meg.<br><br>Remember that time he anonymously paid my college tuition? says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>That time he donated his Buick to the Park District? says Meg. Anonymously?<br><br>On a more serious note, to somewhat shift gears, the lady says. There are rumors afloat, of a secret cadre of folks who are, one might say, mind-washed, or sort of like zombies who just show up? Individuals blanked-out mentally, then reprogrammed—human robots, so to speak—who arrive en masse, even in buses, for propaganda purposes, sans minds of their own?<br><br>Silence.<br><br>I did not understand what you just said, please explain, I say.<br><br>He gets confused so easily, Meg says. These days. At his age.<br><br>When he was younger? Jer says. Never confused. Sharp as a tack.<br><br>Just one sharp uncle, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Of ours, says Meg.<br><br>And that darn beating probably didn’t help much, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Have you, Greg, to the best of your recollection, received any training or programming of this kind? the lady says. Can you name, for example, the place of your birth?<br><br>Meg touches her hat.<br><br>Special high-school memories? the lady says. A show you enjoyed as a child? Who are you, Greg? In what do you, yourself, believe?<br><br>*Freedom*, I say. For *poor* and *sick*. And defend *weak* from *oppressors*.<br><br>Ha, oh boy, the lady says. That is rich. Defend the weak? Allentown, Pennsylvania, Greg: ring a bell? Certain brutal events that occurred there to some union-organizer folks in a mini-mall? Galena, Illinois, what transpired there, tragically, last July, to a group of unarmed middle-school teachers?<br><br>Meg touches her hat, clears throat.<br><br>What is your last name, Greg? the lady says. Do you even know it? The approximate year of the moon landing? The name of the football team from Cleveland? How is it that this house was rented only three days ago? Why, when you fellows chant, do you always chant the same four words?<br><br>Meg clears throat, widens eyes, touches hat.<br><br>*Bastard*, *turd*, *creep*, *idiot*, the lady says.<br><br>I hop up, excuse self, go to bathroom.<br><br>You call yourself a journalist? Kennedy&nbsp;B. says.<br><br>You call yourself a person? the lady says.<br><br>I wait in bathroom until ladies, *camera*, leave.<br><br>Cat in *tub*&emsp;Curled up happy&emsp;Why O why cannot I be more like it?&emsp;Not confused&emsp;Just curled up&emsp;My tub making my purr be louder.<br><br>Jer comes in&emsp;closes door&emsp;leans against.<br><br>O.K., that was unfortunate, Jer says. That lady? Janet Ardmore, KTODNewsTeamTwo? Stinker. Real crankypants. Kind of biased. Strange view of the world. Bit of a liar. Funny how badness will just say whatever, you know? But, I admit, we’re in a bind. And, no offense: you are one shit interview, pal.<br><br>I do not understand what you just said, please explain, I say.<br><br>Door flies open&emsp;Meg and Kennedy&nbsp;B. squeeze in&emsp;Jer steps into tub with slight look of *yikes*.<br><br>Cat races out.<br><br>Jer, KZIP’s calling and calling, says Meg. WDUC’s parked right up the frigging street. In that yellow van. With the beak on it.<br><br>I do not understand what you just said, please explain, I say.<br><br>You know what, 89? says Meg. You’re going to stop saying that. You’re driving me freaking nuts with that.<br><br>Meg’s stressed, says Jer.<br><br>We’re all stressed, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, I am not some bitch made of stone, says Meg.<br><br>I never said you were a bitch made of stone, says Kennedy&nbsp;B. I said you could sometimes be a very company lady.<br><br>Glimm’s on his way over, says Meg. With the portable. Right? Totally works: we Rescrape. Per the *qapp*{: .small}. Which we should’ve done long ago. It’s brain damage. We say. To whoever. From the beating. See? Win-win. Afterward, 89’s subdued and blank. Can’t speak. At all. Who did it? Them. They did. Beat a nice old guy so bad they blanked him right out. And they call themselves moral? Like that.<br><br>What a shame, says Jer. Total waste of a year.<br><br>He has to consent, Kennedy&nbsp;B. says soft&emsp;ly&emsp;handing Meg a *page*&emsp;by hand.<br><br>Are you sad, pal, are you scared, do you know what’s about to happen? says Jer.<br><br>The time for delicate feelings is I don’t know when, says Meg. But not now.<br><br>Miles and miles up shit creek here, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>And just like snap&emsp;at her word of *creek*&emsp;I know&emsp;*creek:* is that&emsp;is that which&emsp;at edge of which we&emsp;would build *ramp*&emsp;of *snow*&emsp;*snowramp*&emsp;If jump no good?&emsp;Boy and *sled* fell in *creek*&emsp;Boy must run home, pants of *ice*, dragging *sled*&emsp;Pants getting more *ice* with each cold step&emsp;through quiet blue winter town&emsp;toward home sweet<br><br>*Ma*, I think.<br><br>Then see her so clear:&emsp;*Flour* in hair&emsp;Mouth going O at sight of *icepants*&emsp;Which I am to leave by door&emsp;on *Hefty bag*, spread out&emsp;Here is *Vixen*&emsp;Our *dog!*&emsp;Sniffing my *icepants*&emsp;which I am no longer&emsp;which lie now on *Hefty bag*&emsp;In shape of boy doing dance:&emsp;one leg bent.<br><br>Jer leans against sink&emsp;Makes desk of own back&emsp;Meg puts page on Jer’s backdesk&emsp;hands me pen.<br><br>So 89, this is just going to be your CF-201B, Meg says. Addendum to your CF-201A. Which you already signed. Happily. Gladly. Earlier.<br><br>When you first joined us, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>Joined our team, says Meg.<br><br>It doesn’t hurt, 89, says Kennedy&nbsp;B. Remember? It’s just with magnets and whatnot?<br><br>How would he remember that, doofus? says Meg.<br><br>He seems to actually remember kind of a lot, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>If I ever lied to you, 89, which I didn’t? Jer says. Or deceived you? Or withheld or misrepresented certain information? It was for your own good. To make your life better.<br><br>Jer, why are you even going there right now? says Meg.<br><br>Sometimes, to do good, there are steps along the way at which goodness must be temporarily set aside or lost sight of, says Jer.<br><br>Hooray, says Meg. Good meeting.<br><br>Make your “X,” 89, says Jer.<br><br>Maybe now we can get out of this stupid tiny bathroom at least, says Kennedy&nbsp;B.<br><br>I love that idea so much, says Meg.<br><br>Carol, I say.<br><br>What’s that, 89? says Jer.<br><br>Carol Spencer, I say. Carol&nbsp;K. Spencer.<br><br>Ah, shit, says Meg. Perfect.<br><br>Carol&nbsp;K. Spencer, 439 Becker Street, Schenectady, New York, I say. 12304.<br><br>Then place pen in sink&emsp;Polite&emsp;ly.<br><br>Per Meg&emsp;Jer takes me into *yard*&emsp;For *frank urgent pep talk pronto*.<br><br>This, right now, 89? says Jer. *Dusk*. That there? *Aspen*. Over there? *Storage shed*. *Gate*. *Sunflowers*. This thing blowing? *Breeze*. Check that out. Up there. Did you even know that was a thing?<br><br>*Sun* and *moon* in sky at once.<br><br>You seem agitated, pal, says Jer. Standoffish. Not your usual peppy self.<br><br>I blink.<br><br>Would like to visit, I say.<br><br>Visit what? Jer says.<br><br>*Ma*, I say.<br><br>Ha, wow, interesting, Jer says. Bargaining. Pretty advanced. Is that your, uh, demand, 89? Like, pre-signing demand? We take you to see your mother, you sign?<br><br>Yes? I say.<br><br>I’m going to level with you, 89, Jer says. Have we done *level with you*? Figure of speech?<br><br>*Tell the truth*, I say.<br><br>Remember when we had all those moths back at Room Valiant? Jer says. And sprayed? And they were like lying all over everything? Not moving? And we swept them up and bagged them up and all of that? Those moths? Were *dead*. Had *died*. Perfectly normal. Remember Gladys? Who used to clean Room Valiant? Remember when Gladys started no longer coming in? A person reaches a certain age.<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d4c5c149984ea00086de1b3]<br><br>No spring chicken, I say.<br><br>Exactly, Jer says. Happens to everybody. Even you. Even me. Our mothers, even. I mean, think about it, 89, how old are you? Seventy-five, eighty? Your mother would, of course, be older.<br><br>Low over yard comes V of birds.<br><br>*Geese*, says Jer. That sound? *Honk*.<br><br>The *honks* go deeper, lower as *geese* fly farther&emsp;further&emsp;One *geese* falls behind&emsp;Flies funnily faster until back home again&emsp;in his or her V.<br><br>My mother is *death*? I say.<br><br>Ha, no, your mother is not *death*, 89, Jer says. She is *dead*. Has *died*. Is how we might say that one. Sorry. Sorry for your loss. Must be painful. To forget your mother existed, then remember she existed, then right away find out she’s all of a sudden dead? Ouch. I thought I had it bad, when I knew all along my mom existed and then she died. But, sadly, this is the type of painful thing that occurs when a person gets a subpar Scrape.<br><br>*Level with me*, I say.<br><br>Just did, says Jer.<br><br>Again, I say.<br><br>We’re crazy tight on time, 89, Jer says.<br><br>How did I get here? I say.<br><br>Back door swings open&emsp;Shape of light runs out&emsp;*Lightshape*&emsp;To Jer&emsp;Jer’s shoes&emsp;Which light up&emsp;With light.<br><br>Glimm’s here, says Kennedy&nbsp;B. He needs help. With the portable. My back is shit and Meg’s back is shit. So.<br><br>Kennedy&nbsp;B. goes back in, closes door.<br><br>*Lightshape* follows.<br><br>Yard dark.<br><br>Speaking again, or still, of *death*, 89? Jer says. Look how weird and slow you walk. How short of breath. Are you entirely well, totally young? We, as a company, paid for a routine physical. Charitably. For all you folks living under that bridge. For lots of folks, living under a number of bridges, across a number of states. Results, for you? Not great. So you said, intelligently, to yourself, Hey, do I want to sicken and die under this bridge over the next ten to eighteen months, in the company of those same drugging/drinking creeps who have bullied and treated me like shit most of my adult life, or go live somewhere safe, out West, with killer meals and free meds and a team of young colleagues who’ll watch over me and maybe even put some purpose back into my life?<br><br>Blink.<br><br>Here’s what the *qapp*{: .small} says, Jer says. *In the event of a subpar Scrape, should Associate refuse recommended Rescrape, Associate is to be removed from Program immediately and restored to his or her Locale of Origin*, which, for you, brother, means: we ship you back East and plop you under that same old bridge, among the fighting and the smoke and the filth. Which is something I don’t cherish doing to someone I’ve come to respect and, to be frank, even love.<br><br>Blink.<br><br>Sorry to be so blunt, 89, says Jer.

Next thing you know, you wake up fresh, whole new start.<br><br>No more looking backward, 89, says Jer. Only forward. From now on.<br><br>With us, says Kennedy&nbsp;B. Your friends.<br><br>Until the end, says Jer.<br><br>Doesn’t that sound nice, 89? says Meg.<br><br>Yes, I say.<br><br>But can we give a few secs? I say.<br><br>Can *we* give *you* a few secs, says Jer.<br><br>Can you give me a few secs?
