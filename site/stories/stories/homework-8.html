I work from home, so I’m around when George gets in from school. He sits at the kitchen table, and I bring him some milk in his Manchester United mug and a plate with a teatime snack. This might be a slice of toast and honey with a peeled satsuma from which I have removed any stray threads of pith, or perhaps an apple, cored and cut into fine slices, with a few cubes of Cheddar.<br><br>Quite often I’m not able to stop what I’m doing, and then I have to stay put. I call out from my desk to say hello when I hear the front door. He calls hello back and makes his way to the television. I’d rather catch up on work in the evening, but I don’t always have a choice.<br><br>“Can’t do what?” I repeated. “I’m sure you can.”<br><br>“You don’t *know*. Everybody says it’s really hard. And now I’ve got to give it in for tomorrow.”<br><br>“Why do you do this? Why do you leave it to the last minute?”<br><br>That’s another wonderful thing about George—you can tell him off and he won’t immediately go into orbit like some I could mention. He’s not a great one for flying off the handle.<br><br>“It’s just so hard,” he moaned.<br><br>“Now, come on,” I said, drying my hands and patting his nice strong shoulder. “Sit up and tell me what it is. You never know, I might be able to help.”<br><br>“It’s Mr. Mottram,” he said, heaving himself up from his slump. “It’s English, so it should be all right, but he still wants to make it hard. We’ve got to do three sides of paper out of our own heads.”<br><br>George is already taller than me and can lift me off the ground. One or two of his friends have had their growth spurts, so that I find myself deferring to the sudden height and booming voice of a boy whom last year I knew as a clear-skinned little pipsqueak.<br><br>“What is it, this terrible task he’s set you?”<br><br>“ ‘Write About an Event That Changed Your Life,’ ” George said with mournful sarcasm. “*That’s* what it is.”<br><br>“Three pages is a lot.” Then a thought occurred to me. “You’ve had all the Easter holidays to do this, haven’t you? And you just didn’t let on about it. Now it’s your first week back and the chickens have come home to roost.”<br><br>“I know,” he said, spreading his hands palms upward in front of him. “There’s no excuse.”<br><br>“What have your friends done?”<br><br>“Dylan’s written about when he went to a football match with his uncle, Crystal Palace versus Queens Park Rangers, and realized Crystal Palace was the team he wanted to follow for the rest of his life.”<br><br>“I can’t see how he filled three sides of paper with that.”<br><br>“He said it only took up one page even in big writing,” George said. “Now he’s got to, you know, pad it out. He’s going to describe all the Crystal Palace matches he’s been to since then, one at a time.”<br><br>Serves Mr. Mottram right, I thought; I don’t know what he can be expecting from a class of thirteen-year-olds. They can’t know what a life-changing event is at their age. How can they know if what happened to them last year will have changed them in twenty years’ time? They won’t know till they get there.<br><br>“I shouldn’t really help you,” I said. “I should leave you to get on with it. But if I do . . .”<br><br>“Yes?” George said, propped up on his elbows, eying me with wary optimism.<br><br>“*If* I help you, you’ve got to understand it’s only this once.”<br><br>“Course,” he said with a beaming smile of relief. “You know I’m not like that, Mum.”<br><br>“Yes.” I smiled back. “I do know. I trust you.”<br><br>“ ’Cause you can,” he said, shrugging.<br><br>“All right then, let’s think.”<br><br>I sat down at the kitchen table and watched him assume a thoughtful expression. He furrowed his brow and chewed at the end of his Biro, then caught my eye and started to giggle.<br><br>“I’d rather write about anything else in the world,” he complained.<br><br>“Just think,” I said. “In fifty years’ time you might really want to write about the Event That Changed Your Life. In your old age you might find you’re desperate to set down your memories. Look at Grandma.”<br><br>My mother had recently filled half a red Silvine exercise book with startlingly deadpan revelations. Her father had, at the age of fourteen, rejected a future as a farm laborer and walked down from Wakefield to London to find work; at first he slept wrapped in old newspaper on benches along the Embankment. That was before he went to fight in France. *His* father had been, among other things, a prizefighter at country fairs, more or less on the wrong side of the law all his life.<br><br>“No,” George said, shaking his head firmly. “*Boring*.”<br><br>“You might find it interesting when you get older,” I persisted. “I never knew that her mother, your great-grandmother, was found as a newborn baby wrapped in a flour sack on the church steps early one Sunday morning. That accounts for a lot.”<br><br>I’m glad I wasn’t born at a time when you had to stay with the father of your children even if he broke your jaw.<br><br>“Where was *I* born?” asked George, who knew perfectly well.<br><br>“Willesden General,” I said. “Then I kept you beside me in a basket all the time for months and months. You were a lovely mild baby, like a dewdrop.”<br><br>George smiled a gratified smile. “But I did cry sometimes,” he prompted.<br><br>“Yes, but when you cried it just made me laugh,” I said. “You didn’t wail in a high-pitched way; no, it was more like the roar of a lion, and then only when you wanted milk. When you were hungry, you just roared!”<br><br>He smirked at this and gave an illustrative growl.<br><br>Following his birth, I’d had an urge to find out more about my family tree. After a while I gave up. It had branches and twigs and leaves in every corner of the British Isles. There were shipwrights and ropemakers in Northumberland, laborers in Lincolnshire, watchmen and peddlers and blacksmiths from Ipswich and Barnstaple and Carlisle. The further back I went, the further afield they spread out. It seemed pointless. George was from all over the place.<br><br>“Life-changing events,” I said, returning to the business in hand. “Let’s think of some examples.”<br><br>“If you win the lottery,” George suggested.<br><br>“Or lose all your money,” I said. “Go bankrupt like Dad’s dad. Skip the country like my uncle Colin.”<br><br>“Yes,” George said, pen poised, looking less hopeful.<br><br>“What would change the life of a thirteen-year-old, though? That’s the question,” I reminded myself. “The death of a parent, certainly, but I don’t want you writing about that because it might bring bad luck.”<br><br>“Jacob’s mother died,” George commented. “He doesn’t want to talk about it.”<br><br>“No,” I said. “Poor Jacob. What did she die of?”<br><br>“He says cancer. But Ranjit told me it wasn’t that, it was a bottle of tablets.” George shrugged. “I don’t know.”<br><br>“No,” I said again. Jacob would get by till middle age, probably, when he would step onto this death as onto the tines of a garden fork, and the solid shaft of the handle would rear up and hit him in the face.<br><br>“So, not death,” I said. “Because that’s the obvious one. No, it’ll have to be your parents’ divorce.”<br><br>“But you’re not divorced.”<br><br>“Well, we are in this story.”<br><br>“He’ll think it’s really true,” George said, looking worried.<br><br>“So?” I said. “It’ll fill three sides of paper. Let’s have the mum leaving the dad for a change, rather than the other way around. And you have to move from your family house to a flat, and your new bedroom is tiny and you have to share it with your little brother, who drives you mad.”<br><br>“I haven’t got a little brother.”<br><br>“Mr. Mottram doesn’t know that.”<br><br>My siblings are scattered far and wide. Sharon runs a bed-and-breakfast up by Hadrian’s Wall. Valerie has an alpha-male job in the City, just like her husband, and they live in a big house in Wimbledon. Keith has had various irons in the fire over the years, but now he’s teaching English as a foreign language in China. Very modern Britain, our family.<br><br>George looked at me warily. I could see that he was torn between his natural fantasy-hating honesty and a desire to have someone else do his homework.<br><br>“Is it allowed?” he asked.<br><br>“Yes,” I said. “It’s English, isn’t it? Don’t they call this bit creative writing? Well, you’re just being creative.”<br><br>“Ha,” George said.<br><br>“Inventive,” I added. “It’s a *good* thing. Listen, you want to watch the match tonight, don’t you? Chelsea versus Liverpool, isn’t it?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“In which case you’d better get this homework finished before dinner. Which I’m doing specially for seven o’clock, because I know you like all that warmup chat beforehand.”<br><br>“Thanks, Mum.”<br><br>I couldn’t resist giving him a hug, the roaring dewdrop baby who had grown into this broad-shouldered boy. Last week I’d been making flapjacks while he stood by to lick the spoon, and I mentioned that I’d always liked the picture of the lion on the Golden Syrup tin. “Out of the strong came forth sweetness,” he read aloud, peering at the green-and-gold picture. “That’s what’s written underneath it.” I never knew that before.<br><br>“Have you got your pen ready? I’m not going to write this for you, you know; I’m only going to give you ideas.”<br><br>“O.K.,” he agreed. He was in no position to object.<br><br>“Your parents had been having arguments for years. You remember the slammed doors and bitter words from when you were little,” I began.<br><br>George started to write.<br><br>“You tried to blot it out, but you couldn’t help feeling upset inside. It got into your dreams. You could put a bad dream in, George; that would take up a few lines.”<br><br>“What about?”<br><br>“Oh, an earthquake perhaps,” I said. “I was always dreaming about earthquakes and floods and fires when I was your age. Or you’re in a house and it falls down around you and you try to run, but the ground opens up in front of you.”<br><br>“To pad it out a bit?” George said.<br><br>“If you like. Then there’s the divorce, which is a relief after all the fighting.”<br><br>“Why did Auntie Sharon get divorced?”<br><br>“I don’t know,” I said, tutting. “They seemed quite happy to start with, but then Mike turned into a bear with a sore head when she had the twins. Some people find domestic life more of a trial than others.”<br><br>“Dad loves domestic,” George commented. “On Fridays when he gets back home, he says, ‘Ah, domestic bliss.’ ”<br><br>“Yes, well,” I said with a stunted smile.<br><br>“Auntie Sharon lives in the nicest place, and she’s got three dogs, but Auntie Valerie’s got the best job,” George said. “Her family goes on the best holidays, and they’ve got an Audi and a BMW. I want a BMW when I get a job. That’s the first thing I’ll buy.”<br><br>“Oh, really.” I sniffed. “The only time they all manage to get together as a family is when they go on some expensive safari thousands of miles away.”<br><br>“Just because they’ve got good jobs,” George said, “you shouldn’t be jealous.”<br><br>“I’m not jealous!” I declared. “How could I be jealous of anyone working those ridiculous hours? They’ve sold their souls.”<br><br>“Oh, Mum,” George said reprovingly.<br><br>“Anyway, after the divorce you have to move house and change schools.”<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>“Because you do. Money. Jobs. And you go and live with your father and your little brother, and you visit your mother at weekends. You might even ask if you can go and live with your grandma for a while.”<br><br>“Why?” George said again, large-eyed, even more down in the mouth.<br><br>“For a break,” I said absently.<br><br>Grow up in certain homes and it’s like being out on a cold, choppy sea in an open dinghy with two angry fishermen in charge. Or sometimes just a single fisherman, who is, what’s more, drunk. Whereas with a grandparent life for a child can be less dangerous, more like being afloat on a reservoir.<br><br>“What happens next?”<br><br>“The mum wants a new start. She wants to see the world! Everybody else has.”<br><br>“But, Mum, Mr. Mottram will think it’s really you.”<br><br>“When you think about it,” I mused, “it’s none of Mr. Mottram’s business. He should only be interested in it as a piece of writing. Is it a good piece of writing? Is it convincing?”<br><br>“What if he asks me?” George muttered.<br><br>“He won’t. He’s an English teacher, isn’t he, not a psychotherapist. So if he did ask you he’d just be being nosy.”<br><br>George shrugged helplessly.<br><br>When I went to live with my grandmother for a while, she had enough to eat but not quite enough to keep warm. She was over seventy, but she had kept on one of her old cleaning jobs—Mrs. Blincoe—mainly for the sake of being in a house with central heating. I’d go along to help with the floors; then, while she polished and dusted, I’d puzzle over the Latin homework that held my enfranchisement. She never considered this work demeaning, and in fact looked down on Mrs. Blincoe as an unfeminine woman, a cold woman who had made her husband lonely and who did not grieve when he died but said, “Now I’m free to do what I want to do,” and went off round the world on various package holidays. The cheerful bearded sailor on her packet of Players was as close as my grandmother ever got to the sea. She cooked with a cigarette in her mouth; quite often ash would fall into the gravy, and she would stir it in as extra seasoning.<br><br>“Listen, you’re doing ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ aren’t you?” I continued. “Do you think Shakespeare got asked whether he’d ever grown donkey’s ears?”<br><br>George smiled briefly.<br><br>“Right. So you see your mum at weekends, and one weekend she tells you she wants to go to Peru and asks if she can borrow your Duke of Edinburgh rucksack. She promises she’ll send you postcards. It’s just something she’s got to do to move forward in her life.”<br><br>George scribbled away, not happy with where the story line was going but incapable of coming up with an alternative. I felt powerful, like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat.<br><br>“I still don’t think it’s allowed,” he said.<br><br>“Of course it’s allowed,” I said. “You’ve got to have things happening, see, or it’s not a story. Think of the films you like. Car chases. Explosions. Sharks.”<br><br>“Can the mum be swimming in the China Sea and then a shark comes up?” George asked hopefully, trying to enter into the creative spirit.<br><br>“Probably not,” I said dryly. “That might be a step too far for Mr. Mottram, don’t you think?”<br><br>“But you said—”<br><br>“Yes, but we’ve got to make it believable. It’s like a game, isn’t it? He shouldn’t be able to tell what’s real and what’s made up.”<br><br>“I’d like to go to Japan,” George said. “They’ve got the new Nintendo Wii there, and I could get it way ahead of everybody else. Plus, you don’t have to have injections to go there.”<br><br>“Next,” I said. “I think the dad meets someone else, don’t you? At first he’s just been going to work and coming back and cooking nasty teas. You’ve had to help—buying a loaf of bread on the way home from school, that sort of thing, and doing the washing up without being asked.”<br><br>“Isn’t there a dishwasher in the new place?”<br><br>“It’s broken. And nobody gets round to finding someone to mend it, and, anyway, you’re all out all day. Maybe your little brother can be in because he’s ill, though. Chicken pox.”<br><br>“My little brother can’t be left on his own,” George objected. “If he’s seven or eight or something. That’s against the law.”<br><br>“O.K., you’ve got an older sister instead.”<br><br>“*She* can cook,” he said with satisfaction. The meals were worrying him.<br><br>“No, she can’t,” I said. “She just eats crisps and bananas. No, it’s the dad that has to do it after work, unless you start teaching yourself from a cookbook.”<br><br>George looked up from his pad suspiciously. I was always trying to get him interested in cutting up broccoli florets or making omelettes.<br><br>“The dad should do it,” he protested. “I’m a kid, it’s not my job. Kids should be looked after by their parents.”<br><br>“You’re thirteen, George!” I said. I was about to bring up the walk from Wakefield, but then I stopped myself. “Oh well, it’s your story. The dad does the cooking, but it’s always pasta.”<br><br>“Cool,” George said, grinning.<br><br>“And the pasta is always soggy.” I scowled. “Feel free to carry on.”<br><br>“No, no,” he said. “After you.”<br><br>“He’s been trying to cook, but he’s no good at it. Then he meets, let’s see, Miranda. You know she’s not nasty or anything, but she’s got nothing to do with you. And he starts including her in on everything.”<br><br>“How?”<br><br>“She’s always there when he’s around, watching television with you, in between you on the sofa.”<br><br>“What, even when football’s on?”<br><br>“Yes. She pretends to like it. She says she’s a Chelsea supporter.”<br><br>“Chelsea,” George said grimly.<br><br>“One weekend your mum tells you she’s off backpacking in three days’ time, first stop Thailand,” I continued. “We need to wind this up, George. She promises she’ll send postcards. You could have them arriving a bit later on with little messages—you know, ate fried tortoise, went bungee jumping, that sort of thing. You could stick them on the fridge so Miranda can see them.”<br><br>“Maybe she can cook.”<br><br>“Not likely,” I said. “She’s not interested in food. She doesn’t see why she should, anyway. Why *should* she? Then it’s the last straw. You’ve just had another of these postcards; the mum’s got as far as Australia. And your dad announces that your holiday this year is camping in Wales—there’s no money for anything else. He can stretch to walking boots for you and your sister, but that’s it.”<br><br>“Wales,” George said, with leaden emphasis.<br><br>“I think you can leave it somewhere there,” I said airily. “It’s April now—people are planning their summer holidays. Mr. Mottram will buy that.”<br><br>“But how do I finish it off?”<br><br>“You don’t have to really; you don’t have to solve everything. It’s not a police procedural. But you’re right, you do need something.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I know,” I said. “Pull in your love of football. All these months since the divorce you’ve turned to football to help you forget. This year you’ve been following the Champions’ League with a passion. Is your team doing all right in it? Manchester United?”<br><br>“Last night’s game was *amazing*, Mum,” George said earnestly. “Rooney scored this goal in the ninety-first minute, and I couldn’t believe it.” He shook his head in wonder. “It was unbelievable.”<br><br>“Was he happy?”<br><br>“He did this full-body dive all the way along the grass, then he lay with his head on his arms, and they all bundled in on top of him. We were playing at home, though—it might not be so good in the away match.”<br><br>“You can put all that in, just like you’ve told it to me.” I’d been struck by a thought. “Now, what does the Man U crowd chant when it wants the team to win? You know, like Tottenham’s is ‘Come on, you Spu-urs.’ ”<br><br>“*united*{: .small}! *united*{: .small}!” George chanted automatically.<br><br>“There you are,” I said. “That’s your last paragraph. You explain how football has got you through your parents’ divorce. You describe Rooney’s great goal in the ninety-first minute. How your team means so much to you. Then you write how you joined in with the TV crowd shouting, “*united*{: .small}! *united*{: .small}!” And you round it off with the words ‘Ironic, really.’ ”<br><br>“Ha,” said George, who wasn’t slow on the uptake, even if the pilot light of his imagination had yet to flare into action. He smiled reluctantly and started to write this down.<br><br>I looked at his fair head bent over the writing pad. The time for advice was almost gone. Beware heat without warmth. When a man loses his temper, people say, That’s the Irish in him, or the Scottish, or the Viking. Don’t listen to them. Dirty players or terriers are what they call footballers with that anger-stoked edge, but strength without sweetness is no use at all.<br><br>“Ironic because?” I asked.<br><br>“The mum and the dad. They’re *not* united.”<br><br>“There you are.”<br><br>I glanced at the kitchen clock.<br><br>“I’ve got to get on,” I said. “I’ve got my own work to do.”<br><br>“That’s all right,” he said, smiling up at me. “You go. I can do it now.”&nbsp;♦<br><br>
