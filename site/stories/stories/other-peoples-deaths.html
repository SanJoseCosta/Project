Again, Ilka was earnest in begging to be left right here, wanted the baby to stay here with her. No thank you, really, she did not need—did not want—anybody sleeping over.<br><br>The friends and colleagues trooped down the path: Leslie Shakespeare, the director, and Joe Bernstine, the co-founder of the Concordance Institute—genus think tank, of which Ilka was, and poor Jimmy had been, junior members—and their colleagues the Ayes, the Zees, the Cohns, and the Stones. Outside the gate they stopped, they looked back, but Ilka had taken the baby inside and closed the door. They stood for a moment, they talked, not accounting to themselves for the intense charm of the summer hill rising behind Ilka’s house, of standing, of breathing—of the glamour of being alive. Leslie asked everyone to come over for a drink.<br><br>The report of the accident had come at the very moment the committee was about to vote on Jimmy’s retention.<br><br>Jimmy had told Ilka not to worry when he accepted the job as the institute’s director of projects: what he didn’t know about the *Who’s Who* of scholarship he would pick up as he went along. Ilka had worried. She watched him not writing the book stipulated in his contract. She watched him worry when he screwed up the institute’s directories on the new computer. Called on the carpet most recently for failing to file a duplicate of his letter to one conference participant, Jimmy had failed to confess that he couldn’t find the fellow’s address. Leslie Shakespeare had sent Jimmy out of town on institute business while his retention was under discussion.<br><br>The friends and colleagues began to move along the sidewalk in groups and pairs. Alfred Stone walked with his wife, Alpha. Alfred was a doctor, the only one of the group unconnected with the work of the institute. It was he who had attended at the scene of the accident. As he walked, he was arranging the sentence he ought to have spoken to the widow when he arrived at her house or at some moment in the hours since.<br><br>Everybody stopped at the corner. Ilka’s door had opened and the two policemen came out. They had spent the day in the hallway trying to look inconspicuous. Now that the dead man, brought so inexplicably home from the scene of the accident, had been removed, they could finally leave. The small Puerto Rican policeman walked out the gate, but the big young policeman turned to wave. Ilka must be standing back in the darkness. The two policemen got into their car and drove away.<br><br>Inside her foyer Ilka closed the door and leaned her head against it, devastated at everybody’s leaving.<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### WORDS TO SPEAK TO THE WIDOW<br> <br><br>At the Shakespeares’ there was the business of walking into the sitting room, of sitting down, of the drinks. “A lot of ice, Leslie. Thanks.” “Martini, please, and hold the vegetables.”<br><br>Little, agile Joe Bernstine smiled sadly. “I wonder if we retained Jimmy.”<br><br>Leslie Shakespeare said, “Alpha will schedule us a new search committee.”<br><br>Nobody said, We could hardly do worse than poor Jimmy.<br><br>Jenny Bernstine said, “Ilka is being very gallant and terrific.”<br><br>Nobody said, She didn’t cry.<br><br>Alicia Aye said, “Ilka isn’t one to throw her hands up.”<br><br>“Or the towel in, *or* the sponge,” said Eliza Shakespeare. “Joke. Sorry!”<br><br>Alicia said, “Ilka is not one to drown in her sorrows.”<br><br>“Well, I’m going to drown mine,” Eliza said, holding her glass out to Leslie, who refilled it.<br><br>Alicia said, “We live on borrowed time.”<br><br>Alpha asked her husband, “The policeman said there was fire?” and the friends’ and colleagues’ imaginations went into action to dim or scramble or in some way unthink the flames in which Jimmy—this person they knew—was burning. They wished to avoid an image of which they would never entirely be able to rid themselves.<br><br>Dr. Stone replied that Jimmy’s body had been thrown clear of the burning car. The fall had broken his neck.<br><br>The flames went out. The friends envisaged an unnaturally angled head with Jimmy’s face.<br><br>Dr. Alfred Stone took his drink and sat down. He was a very large man, with a large head that, Ilka had once told the Shakespeares, she thought would look good on Mt. Rushmore. Eliza said that jaw, that forelock were from the Sunday funnies—the muscle-bound superhero with the heart of tin. “Aw!” Ilka had said. “Poor Alfred! I like Alfred.” Dr. Stone looked around the room and located his wife, Alpha, sitting beside Eliza Shakespeare. Were they talking about the death? Alfred had, earlier in the day, looked across another room and seen Alpha talking with Ilka. He had wondered what words Alpha might be saying to the widow: To refer to the death would be putting a finger in the wound, but how *not* to mention it? And wasn’t it gross to be talking of anything else? Alfred mistakenly believed himself to be singularly lacking in what normal people—the people in this room—were born knowing. He thought that other people knew how to feel and what to say. He watched them walk out and return with drinks. They stood together, they talked. Dr. Stone remained sitting.<br><br> <br><br>_**_**<br><br> <br><br>At eleven o’clock that first night a brutal loneliness knocked the wind out of Ilka. Then her phone rang. “We thought we’d see how you were doing,” Leslie said. “Did the baby get to sleep?”<br><br>“The baby is O.K. I’m O.K. Is it O.K. to be O.K.? I could do with some retroactive lead time. I need to practice taking my stockings off with Jimmy dead. Relearn how to clean my teeth.”<br><br>Leslie said, “Wait.” Ilka heard him pass on to Eliza, who must be in the room, who might be lying in the bed beside him, that Ilka was O.K. but needed to relearn how to clean her teeth with Jimmy dead. His voice returned full strength. “Eliza says we’re coming over in the morning to bring you breakfast.”<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### SITTING SHIVAH<br> <br><br>“I don’t know how,” said Ilka. Joe Bernstine remembered that when his father died his mother had turned the faces of the mirrors to the wall. Ilka was struck by the gesture but embarrassed by its drama. “I know I’m supposed to sit on a low stool, but I can’t get any lower,” she said. She was sitting on the floor tickling Maggie, the fat, solemn, comfortable baby. Baby Maggie’s eyes were so large that they seemed to round the corner of the little face, with its hanging cheeks.<br><br>“A baroque baby,” Eliza said.<br><br>“She’s fun to hold because she collapses her weight in your arms.” Ilka jumped Maggie up and down. “She must have heard me scream when the policemen told me.”<br><br>Eliza unpacked the tiny tomatoes from her garden. She had baked two long loaves of white bread. Jenny was arranging the cold cuts that she had brought onto the platters she had brought. At some point in the morning Joe and Leslie rose to go to the institute. They would be back in an hour. Leslie bent his fine head over Ilka’s hand and brought it to his lips.<br><br>Ilka said, “I called my mother and she’s coming tomorrow.”<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### IN THE INSTITUTE<br> <br><br>Celie, the receptionist, sat at her desk across from the front entrance and fanned herself with an envelope, like someone trying to avoid fainting. She told Betty, one of the assistants, “I talked with him that actual morning! He comes running in, punches the elevator button, doesn’t wait and runs right up those stairs, comes right down. He’s stuffing papers in his briefcase. I told him, ‘You have a good trip now,’ and he says, ‘Oh shit!’ and he’s going to run back up except the elevator door opens, and he gets in.”<br><br>Betty was able to one-up Celie with her spatial proximity to the dead man, though at a greater temporal remove. The day *before* James drove to Washington he had tried to open the door into the conference room with papers under his arm, carrying a cup of coffee, saying, “Anybody got a spare hand?” Betty had held the door for him. He had said, “Oh! Thanks!”<br><br>Could a person for whom one held a door, who said, “Oh shit!” and “Oh! Thanks!” be dead?<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### WORDS TO WRITE TO THE WIDOW<br> <br><br>Nancy Cohn and Maria Zee talked on the telephone and one-upped each other in respect to who was the more upset. “I got to my office,” said Maria, “and just sat.”<br><br>“I,” Nancy said, “never made it to the office, because I kept waking up every hour *on* the hour.”<br><br>“I never got to sleep! I kept waking poor Zack to check if he was alive. He was fit to be tied.”<br><br>“Have you called her?”<br><br>“I thought I would write.”<br><br>“That’s what I will do. I’ll write her,” said Nancy.<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### SITTING SHIVAH, DAY TWO<br> <br><br>“It’s good of you to come,” Ilka said to the visitors. The institute staff dropped over together, after office hours. Celie, Betty, Wendy, and Barbara sat around the table in Ilka’s kitchen. The fellows sat in the living room. Ilka’s mother held the baby on her lap. Ilka let out a sudden laugh, and said, “What’ll I do when the party is over!” She rose, picked up little Maggie, and carried her out of the room, up the stairs, past Dr. Stone hiding in the foyer.<br><br>Dr. Stone believed that by the time Ilka returned he would be ready with a sentence to say to her, but he was relieved, when she came down, that the baby’s head intervened between his face and Ilka’s face, and the front doorbell was ringing again. Martin Moses, a junior member, walked in, took Ilka and her baby into a big hug, and said, “Christ, Ilka!” Ilka said, “Don’t I know it.”<br><br>“Give her to me,” Ilka’s mother said and took the child out of Ilka’s arms.<br><br>Alpha came out of the living room, saying, “Hello, Martin. Ilka, listen, take it easy. You take a couple of days—as long as you like, you know that! Alfred, we have to go.” And the Ayes and the Zees had to go home. Celie and the rest left. Martin left. The Shakespeares said they would be back. Ilka thought that everyone had gone when she heard a gentle clatter in the kitchen. Jenny Bernstine was washing dishes.<br><br>People trickled over in the evening—a smaller crowd, which left sooner. Jenny washed more dishes. When Joe came to pick her up, she looked anxiously at Ilka, who said, “I’m O.K.”<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### WRITING TO THE WIDOW<br> <br><br>Nancy Cohn went to look for Nat. He was on the living-room couch, watching TV.<br><br>Nancy said, “I’m embarrassed not to know what to write to Ilka. It’s embarrassing worrying about being embarrassed, for Chrissake!”<br><br>“Calamity is a foreign country. We don’t know how to talk to the natives.”<br><br>Nancy said, “*You* write her. You’re the writer in the family.”<br><br>“I’m not feeling well,” said Nat.<br><br>“She’s *your* colleague!” said Nancy.<br><br>And so neither of them wrote to Ilka.<br><br> <br><br>_**_**<br><br> <br><br>Maria Zee called Alicia Aye and asked her, “I mean, we went *over* there. Do we still have to write?”<br><br>Alicia said, “Alvin says we’ll have her over next time we have people in.”<br><br> <br><br>### A CASSEROLE<br> <br><br>Celie cooked a casserole and told Art, her thirteen-year-old, to take it over to Mrs. Carl’s house.<br><br>“The woman that her husband burned up in his car? No way!”<br><br>Linda, who was fifteen, said, “For your information, he did *not* even burn up. He broke his neck.” She advised her brother to check his facts.<br><br>Art said, “Linda will go and take it over to her.”<br><br>Well, Linda wasn’t going over there, not by herself, so Celie made them both go.<br><br>Nobody answered the front bell.<br><br>Art said, “I never knew a dead person before.”<br><br>Linda said, “You mean you never knew a person and afterward they died, and you didn’t as a *fact* even know this person at all.”<br><br>Art said, “But I know Mom, and Mom knew him. Ring it again.”<br><br>They found a couple of bricks, piled one on top of the other, and took turns standing on them to look in the window. Those were the stairs the dead man must have walked up and down on. There was a little table with a telephone on it, and a chair. Had the dead man sat on that exact chair and lifted that phone to his ear?<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### RUNNING AWAY<br> <br><br>Yvette Gordot, the institute’s economist, who had not called on Ilka, drove over, rang the bell, saw the casserole by the front door, thought, She’s out, skipped down the steps, got in her car, and drove away.<br><br>“She was out,” Dr. Stone reported to his wife.<br><br>“Who was?”<br><br>“Ilka was out, with the baby. I practically fell over the stroller, corner of Euclid.”<br><br>“What did you say to her?” Alpha asked him<br><br>“Say?” said Alfred. “Nothing. She was across the street on the other sidewalk.”<br><br>Trying to imagine an impossibility hurts the head. Having failed to envisage Alfred falling over a stroller that was on the other sidewalk, Alpha chose to assume that she had missed or misunderstood some part of what he had told her.<br><br>Alfred came to remember not what had happened but what he said had happened. The unspoken words he owed the widow displaced themselves into his chest and gave him heartburn.<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### NIGHT CONVERSATION<br> <br><br>“Celie left a casserole. Alfred fell into Maggie’s stroller,” Ilka reported to the Shakespeares when they phoned at eleven that night.<br><br>Leslie said, “Eliza says, ‘What did Alfred say to you?’ ”<br><br>“He slapped his forehead the way you’re supposed to slap your forehead when you remember something you’ve forgotten—and ran across the street to the other sidewalk. Poor Alfred! He’s so beautiful.”<br><br>Eliza took the phone from Leslie. “Why ‘poor Alfred’ when he’s behaving like a heel?” she asked Ilka.<br><br>Ilka said, “Because Jimmy’s death is making him shy of me. He thinks it’s impolite of him to be standing upright.”<br><br>Eliza said, “The good Lord intended Alfred to be your basic shit, and Alfred went into medicine in the hope of turning into a human being.”<br><br>“Doesn’t he get points for hoping?”<br><br>“Why can’t you just be offended?”<br><br>“Don’t know,” said Ilka. “I mean, people can’t help being heels and shits.”<br><br>“You sound like Jimmy,” said Eliza, and Ilka listened and heard the sound, over the telephone, of Eliza weeping for Ilka’s husband.<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### INVITING THE WIDOW<br> <br><br>Nancy said, “We’ll have her in when we have people over. The Stones are coming Sunday. Only, you think she wants to be around people?”<br><br>“Call her and ask her?” said Nat.<br><br>“You call her and ask her.”<br><br>“*I’m* not going to call her. You call her.”<br><br>“She’s *your* colleague, *you* call her.”<br><br>“I’m not well.”<br><br>“I don’t think she wants to be around people,” Nancy said. “And her mother is staying with her.”<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### DR. ALFRED STONE<br> <br><br>Dr. Alfred Stone continued to mean to say to the widow what, as a doctor—as the doctor who had been on the scene of the accident—he ought and must surely be going to say to her. He always thought that by the next time he was face to face with her he would have found the appropriate words, and blushed crimson when he walked into the Shakespeares’ kitchen and saw little Maggie sitting in a high chair and Ilka crawling underneath the table. She said, “Hi, Alfred. Look what Maggie did to poor Eliza’s floor! And now Bethy is going to take Maggie to play in the yard so the grownups can sit down in peace and quiet. O.K., Bethy. She’s all yours!”<br><br>Bethy Bernstine had grown bigger and bulkier. The bend of Bethy’s waist, as she buttoned the baby into her sweater, cried out to her parents, to her parents’ friends, Watch me buttoning the baby’s sweater! Bethy’s foot on the back stair into the yard pleaded, This is me taking the baby into the yard. Notice me!<br><br>Murphy’s Law seated Dr. Alfred Stone next to the widow. While the conversation was general, he tried for a sideways view of her face, which was turned to Eliza on her other side. Alfred was looking for the mark on Ilka, the sign that her husband had been thrown from a burning car and had broken his neck. Alfred studied his wife across the table. Would Alpha, if he, Alfred, broke *his* neck, look so regular and ordinary? Would she laugh at something Eliza said?<br><br> <br><br>_**_**<br><br> <br><br>As they were leaving, Alpha asked Ilka to dinner and Ilka said, “If I can get a sitter. My mother has gone back to New York.” Jenny Bernstine offered Bethy.<br><br>After that, and for the next few weeks, the friends and colleagues invited Ilka to their dinners. She always said yes. “I’m afraid,” she told the Shakespeares, “that my first ‘No, thank you’ will facilitate the next no and start a future of noes.” Then, one day, as she was driving herself to the Zees’, Ilka drove past their house, made a U-turn, and drove home. She insisted on paying Bethy for the full evening.<br><br>“We missed you,” Leslie said on the telephone.<br><br>“How come it gets harder instead of easier? You put on your right stocking and there’s the left stocking to still be put on, and the right and the left shoe . . . ” Ilka heard Leslie tell Eliza what Ilka said.<br><br>In the morning, Ilka called Maria Zee to apologize, and Maria said, “Don’t be silly!”<br><br>“A rain check?”<br><br>“Absolutely,” said Maria. “Or you call me!”<br><br>“Absolutely,” said Ilka. But Ilka did not call her, and Maria did not call Ilka. One’s house seemed more comfortable without Ilka from Calamity.<br><br>***{: .break one} ** &nbsp; ***<br><br> <br><br>### BETHY BERNSTINE<br> <br><br>The Bernstines and the Shakespeares were the true friends. Ilka loved them and missed Jimmy because he was missing the pleasure of Eliza’s risotto and of Leslie’s wine that yielded taste upon taste on the tongue. Ilka held out her glass, watched Joe’s hand tip the bottle, and thought, Joe will die, not now, not soon, maybe, but he will die. Ilka saw Jenny looking at her with her soft, anxious affection and thought, Jenny will die. “Will you forgive me,” Ilka said to them, “if I take myself home?” Of course, of course! Leslie must drive Ilka. “Absolutely not! Honestly! You would do me the greatest possible favor if you would let me go by myself.” “Joe will drive Ilka.” “Let me drive you!” said Joe. “No, no, no!” cried Ilka. They could see that she was distraught. “Let Ilka alone,” said Leslie. “Ilka will drive herself. Ilka will be fine.”<br><br>Leslie and Joe came out to put Ilka into her car. She saw them, in the rearview mirror, as she drove away, two old friends standing together, talking on the sidewalk. There would be a time when both of them would have been dead for years.<br><br>Bethy was curled on the couch, warm and smelling of sleep, her skin sweet and dewy. Cruel for a sixteen-year-old to be plain—too much chin and jowl, the little, pursed, unhappy mouth. Ilka woke Bethy with a hand on her shoulder. She helped the girl collect herself, straighten her bones, pick her books off the floor. Ilka walked her out and stood on the sidewalk.<br><br>Maggie was sleeping on her back, arms above her head, palms curled. In her throat, and behind her eyes, Ilka felt the tears she could not begin to cry and she feared that beast in the jungle which might, someday, stop the tears from stopping.<br><br>When Leslie called to make sure she had got home, Ilka said, “I’ve been doing arithmetic. Subtract the age I am from the age at which I’m likely to die and it seems like a hell of a lot of years.”<br><br> <br><br>_**_**<br><br> <br><br>Though the words Dr. Alfred Stone had failed to say to Ilka had become inappropriate and could never be said, he tended, when they were in the same room, to move along the wall at the furthest remove from where Ilka might be moving or standing or sitting. ♦<br><br>
