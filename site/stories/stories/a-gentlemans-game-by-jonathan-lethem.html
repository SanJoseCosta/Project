Casual Western dress wasn’t frowned on in Singapore, so long as that meant appalling tourist pastels, striped Lacoste polo shirts, and rack-fresh sports or hip-hop gear, Juicy Couture, and so forth. And that was what you saw. Not this. The American, who had a posture like a question mark, was dressed in layers of baggy, unwashed black polyester, too tight on his paunch, and a Windbreaker over black jeans and running shoes—a costume exhumed from some Dungeons & Dragons basement. His hair, greasy over his ears, had been combed back from an unhealthy scalp; his shave looked five days old. Of course, the fact that Bruno found this arresting was perhaps a sign that he’d been in Singapore too long. The man would have been invisible in America, unless he buttonholed you for a handout.<br><br>Then the man’s features and general comportment, his warped grin and pigeon walk, resolved into those of Bruno’s boyhood acquaintance Keith Stolarsky. Bruno marvelled at the treacherous intensity of restored memory. Since he’d left Berkeley at age seventeen, he’d never once stopped to recall the teen-ager named Keith Stolarsky. Indeed, Stolarsky had been purposely forgotten, with so much else. Yet in his presence each lost gesture and intonation of Stolarsky’s lined up on the front shelf of Bruno’s awareness, waiting to be retrieved. By this process, Stolarsky was magically doubled in Bruno’s gaze. He was simultaneously a forty-seven-year-old wreck—Stolarsky had been a year behind Bruno at Berkeley High—and a frisky, provocative fourteen-year-old, late to mature physically but with an insinuating, gremlin wit.<br><br>“Someone you know?” Edgar Falk asked, at the instant Bruno suffered this recognition. Nothing escaped Falk.<br><br>“Yes,” Bruno said. “From long ago.”<br><br>“A gambler?”<br><br>“I have no idea.”<br><br>Falk’s question, though, was really no different from Bruno’s: What was a man who looked like Keith Stolarsky doing here? The Smoker’s Club wasn’t merely a V.I.P. lounge; it was a secret one, unlisted in the Marina Bay Sands Casino’s own brochures. One didn’t merely wander in. One learned of the place in an aside or a whisper, and was invited. The club eschewed the sterile gloss of the complex’s hotel and casino in favor of a suggestion of Old World glamour: burnished wood panels, brass fixtures, bevelled mirrors. A cloud of cigar fume marked an alcove featuring a never-ending poker game.<br><br>In Falk and Bruno’s case, they’d come to the Smoker’s Club to meet Billy Yik Tho Lim, the former director of the I.S.D., Singapore’s secret police. Lim had got involved in a long-term investment of Falk’s, the fixing of a Korean football match—a matter outside Bruno’s scope of expertise. But in the process the former director had told Falk that he hoped to test himself against the backgammon wizard Falk had been bragging about.<br><br>Falk had been engineering this assignation for weeks, and had set aside a sizable stake. Bruno had his backgammon set on the chair beside him, though the contest was likely to be moved somewhere else. Bruno was always ready. He preferred to use his own set, with its smoothly inlaid points, its simple wood checkers, stained light and dark. No ivory or mother of pearl, no stitched felt or leather points to cushion the play. The clacking of the checkers on the hardwood points was the music of honest thought, resounding in silence as it navigated the fortunes told by the pips on the dice. Bruno had for his entire life associated backgammon with candor, the dice not determining fate so much as revealing character.<br><br>He doubted a man like Lim would play in view of gawkers and bystanders. An apparition like Keith Stolarsky might spook him completely.<br><br>Stolarsky hadn’t come in alone. He was accompanied by a woman, dark-haired and robustly handsome, at least forty when you examined the lines around her mouth, but healthier than Stolarsky by a mile. The woman was dressed in black, too, only to a different effect. A tight sweater and pegged jeans gave the appearance of a film actress dressed slightly down for a part as the girlfriend of a jazz musician or Beat poet. The sweater was tucked above a wide, silver-buckled belt; the refusal to conceal her thick waist was itself brazenly attractive.<br><br>“Invite them over,” Falk suggested.<br><br>“Why should I do that?”<br><br>“For amusement.”<br><br>“He doesn’t recognize me. He probably won’t remember me.”<br><br>“I doubt that.”<br><br>“I haven’t seen him since we were children.” Bruno knew it was the wrong word for who he’d been when he last saw Stolarsky, before he’d departed Berkeley for good. As if catching this thought, Falk said, with luxuriant irony, “You were never a child.”<br><br>Bruno’s decision was made for him. He and Falk were sitting near enough to the path between the entrance and the bar that Keith Stolarsky and his companion passed their table.<br><br>“No fucking way.”<br><br>“Hello, Keith,” Bruno said, as airily as he could manage.<br><br>“Alexander Bruno,” Stolarsky said. “Figures you’d turn up in a place like this.” Stolarsky addressed the woman. “I once told you about this guy. We were eating at Chez Panisse, remember? That there was a kid in my high school who worked as a waiter there, who all the moms were in love with? Then he just floated away? *This is that guy*.”<br><br>“I’m Edgar Falk,” said Falk, holding out his hand.<br><br>Stolarsky gazed at it for a crucial second, as if unsure. His hands had been shoved into his pockets, and he drew out just one.<br><br>“Keith,” he said. “This is Tira.”<br><br>She stuck out her own hand, and Bruno stood a little to accept it, warm and strong, into his. “Tira Harpaz,” she said. Was adding her last name a rebuke to Stolarsky’s manners?<br><br>If so, Stolarsky wasn’t chastened. “What a fucking scenario this is, huh?” he said to Bruno.<br><br>“The Smoker’s Club?”<br><br>“Sure, and Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore, the whole kit and caboodle.”<br><br>“I suppose so.” Bruno released Tira Harpaz’s hand and came up from his chair. “Please sit. What would you like to drink?” He was conscious of wishing to live up to any legend he’d left in his wake at Berkeley High.<br><br>“Nah, you sit, let me buy you a round,” Stolarsky said. “I want to take a look at this joint. What are you having?”<br><br>“Another of these—a Tiger Beer, it’s called. But I’ll go to the bar with you.”<br><br>Falk waved his hand across the top of his glass, which Bruno knew contained only cranberry juice and soda.<br><br>“I’ll have a Tiger Beer, too,” Tira Harpaz said, slipping into a seat.<br><br>“Are you staying at the Sands?” Bruno asked.<br><br>“Not a fucking chance,” Stolarsky said. “I’d feel like a rat in a psych experiment. We’re at Raffles. After some of the joints in Thailand and Sri Lanka, we were ready for a little five-star action. The place is a trip, it’s got that total Kipling vibe.”<br><br>“Naturally,” Falk said. “He lodged there.”<br><br>Again, Stolarsky paused, to measure Falk. Bruno could sympathize. He recalled his first impression of Falk, at White’s, in London. Bruno had been there at the whim of an English peer from whom he’d removed thirty thousand pounds, and who plainly regarded seeing Bruno do similar damage to a number of his friends as adequate compensation for his losses. To the great amusement of the callow swells in the peer’s circle, Falk had been presented to Bruno as “the other American.” With his dyed, seemingly lacquered hair and rouged cheeks, Falk had struck Bruno as much older than sixty, an aging queen with everything to conceal.<br><br>Now, a decade later, Falk looked not a day older. Bruno understood Falk’s Kabuki mask as his true face, and never sought a glimpse underneath. The longer Bruno knew Falk, the less the first impression mattered: Falk seemingly wasn’t aging, might not be a queen. Yet Bruno knew Falk struck others this way. Falk relied upon it.<br><br>“Shit, that’s no better than a Budweiser,” Stolarsky said at the bar, when he’d slurped off the top inch of Tira Harpaz’s Tiger.<br><br>Stolarsky had ordered a Grey Goose Magnum for himself, and now he winced down a mouthful, chasing off his disappointment in the beer, which had left a foam trace on his upper lip.<br><br>“Every nation needs its Budweiser,” Bruno said.<br><br>“O.K., O.K., but listen now, Flashman,” Stolarsky said. He spoke as if they’d been delaying some negotiation for long enough already, for years. “We’re gonna have to fill in some missing chapters here.”<br><br>“Flashman?”<br><br>“Don’t pretend you don’t remember you put me on to those books in high school. George MacDonald Fraser? Flashman the coward, the asshole, the heel? You’ve obviously based your whole life on him. Hell, it was obvious by eleventh grade.”<br><br>Bruno remembered the books, barely. He was more interested, however, by how immune to embarrassment this heap of a man appeared to be.<br><br>“I’ve got the whole sequence in first editions, man. I think of you every time I open one. So who’d you murder for that tuxedo, Alex? Please don’t tell me you’re that old weirdo’s significant other.”<br><br>“No,” Bruno said. It was hardly the first time it had been suggested. If Stolarsky didn’t believe him, it wouldn’t be the first time for that, either.<br><br>“So he’s your C.I.A. handler? Are you about to bust in on some big operation here?” Stolarsky’s tone was sardonic, but it wanted an answer. It had been sardonic, but urgent, too, when a virginal Stolarsky had interrogated Bruno on Bruno’s experiences with girls.<br><br>Still, there was something in Stolarsky’s attentions that made Bruno willing to carry on teasing him. “No,” Bruno said. “Not that, either.”<br><br>“I get it, I’m blowing your cover, huh?”<br><br>“Impossible to do, since I’m utterly uncovered.”<br><br>“Just our man in a tux in a secret club in the Singapore Sands? Did you know this pile of gleaming shit is human history’s most expensive building?”<br><br>“I hadn’t heard.”<br><br>“If you’re not sick of me guessing, I can try to come up with more insults. You’re the waiter, right? Nah, you’re the janitor.”<br><br>“I do clean up from time to time.”<br><br>“Fuck you. You’re a gigolo, obviously. I could buy you for Tira for five hundred of these Singapore dollars, right?”<br><br>“You think you’ve guessed it this time?”<br><br>“Sure, of course I did.”<br><br>“Would you really buy me for Tira?”<br><br>“Sure, but I’d have to be allowed to watch. She gets whatever she wants.”<br><br>“Like that beer?”<br><br>“You’ve got a point, let’s go. I bet she’s pumped that old character actor for your vital statistics, probably got your Social Security number and passwords while I’m still here trying to get in the door, conversational-wise.”<br><br>“Are you telling me the two of you are some sort of grifters?” At this, the balance turned. Bruno laughed in his heart, though his face was still. Stolarsky had no power over him. Bruno’s high-school acquaintance was a barely viable man who’d probably saved his entire life for a package tour in Southeast Asia, likely not even a competent sex tourist but a wannabe, a talker, who’d blundered his way into this room by the act of overtipping some concierge.<br><br>“Yeah, sure, Alex, that’s great, Boris and Natasha Badenov, you caught me.”<br><br>“I doubt she’ll find my associate an easy mark.”<br><br>“Your *associate*? You’re fucking killing me.”<br><br>“I’m a professional gambler, Keith. I relieve wealthy men of the delusion that they’re any good at backgammon.”<br><br>“You hustle *board games*? For real?”<br><br>“For real.” It was possible, Bruno felt, to speak to Stolarsky not merely as though he were still the pesky, craven adolescent Bruno recalled but as if to a child. “Now, let’s bring Tira her indigenous Budweiser, and let’s enjoy ourselves conversational-wise for a minute or two, and then I’d appreciate it if you’d make yourselves scarce.”<br><br>“You’re blowing me off?”<br><br>“Go play poker, or do whatever you were hoping to do in this place. You see, I wasn’t being completely truthful when I said you couldn’t blow my cover. In fact, my associate has arranged a meeting with a very dangerous and corrupt public official, one with an appetite for expensive contests of chance. He’s a rare quarry, and I don’t want to scare him off.”<br><br>“Holy fuck, Flashman, you’re the complete package.”<br><br>“Then, if you like, I’ll pick you and Tira up at your hotel tomorrow at noon, and show you some parts of Singapore that are a little more—textural.”<br><br>As he came out of the glare off Beach Road into the Raffles lobby, Bruno didn’t know if he was in the mood for more of Keith Stolarsky’s banter. The morning after, his schoolmate’s presence at the Smoker’s Club still seemed apparitional. Bruno had kept his promise to visit merely in order to confirm the reality of Stolarsky’s presence, rather than out of any desire for his and his girlfriend’s company. Yet, when Tira Harpaz came downstairs alone, Bruno felt a guilty throb. This was what he’d wished for. She drew a strange excitement out of him.<br><br>She had prepared for the noonday sun in a suitably wide-brimmed straw hat, so Bruno led her out onto the avenue rather than suggesting a cab. He himself wore a Borsalino, shade enough, though he already felt humidity gluing shirt to ribs beneath the unnecessary jacket. When Bruno offered an inquiring glance back at the hotel’s upper stories, Tira shrugged. “My cell works here,” she said. “Keith’ll find us, if he ever wakes up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<br><br>“Fair enough. We can easily walk to Lau Pa Sat for some food from the market stalls. Or in the other direction, to Orchard Road, if you like.”<br><br>“He said you’d promised the underground tour, whatever that consists of.”<br><br>“I hope I wasn’t misleading. To be blunt, by comparison with Thailand and Sri Lanka, you’ll be awfully unimpressed with the underground scene here.”<br><br>“No dens of iniquity?” she teased. “Chewing-gum orgies, nothing?”<br><br>“Orchard Road does feature one very brightly colored condom store. We’ve got the usual massage parlors, but you can’t have come all this distance just for a happy ending now, can you?”<br><br>“Hey, who doesn’t like a happy ending?” Her tone was cryptic but cheery.<br><br>Bruno again twitched his head back toward Raffles. “Late night?”<br><br>“He moaned something about seeing the sun come up and stuck the pillow over his head.”<br><br>“So you got started on the dens of iniquity without me, then? Or Keith did.”<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b67b88a032b339a0cd88a]<br><br>“It’s not like you think. He spent all night drinking Red Bulls from the minibar. He went online and started playing backgammon against machines and people, and then arguing strategy on these forums with all these international night-owl backgammon assholes. He, like, built this whole new backgammon persona for himself in eight or nine hours, which, if you know Keith, is weirdly typical. He woke me up at two and tried to get me to play him, said he’d figured it all out. Of course, I told him to fuck off. He’s hoping to pit himself against you, obviously.”<br><br>“You can learn everything about backgammon online in eight or nine hours, with the precise exception of how to beat someone like me.”<br><br>“He’ll be eager to hear it.”<br><br>“I don’t sit down for less than five hundred Singapore dollars a point.” Bruno wasn’t sure why he’d exaggerated. He’d been in games for lower stakes recently enough. Five hundred, it occurred to him, was the price Stolarsky had suggested it would take to purchase Bruno for Tira Harpaz for the night.<br><br>“Yeah, well, he can afford you.” Now she was sardonic—toward whom, Bruno wasn’t sure. “Is that what you played for last night? Keith said you had a date with the Asian J. Edgar Hoover?”<br><br>“My game last night didn’t materialize.” Whether spooked by the sight of the anomalous Americans or for some other, unknown reason, Lim had sent an emissary with an apology to Falk, deferring the contest.<br><br>“Sorry to hear it. Christ, this heat. This is, like, our fifteenth country, and I’m sick of meandering around in the blazing sunlight. I’d love some iced coffee, though. No offense, but if I didn’t know any better I’d think I was walking in L.A., you know?” She waved at the toy-skyscraper skyline and, nearer, at the narrow, empty pavement, with its inadequate tree cover.<br><br>“None taken. I’ve no stake in your opinion of Singapore. I don’t think much of it myself.”<br><br>“So what’s the appeal? Just ‘The women are cheap and the boys are cheaper’?”<br><br>“I wouldn’t know the price of either. What I like about Singapore is how little it asks of me. It brags three or four native languages, a mélange of cultural styles, and so forth, but in truth it’s perfectly flavorless.”<br><br>“Would you like some ABC gum?”<br><br>“Gum?”<br><br>“Already Been Chewed. Sorry, I read in the guidebook about the prohibition on chewing gum here, and thought of this joke from summer camp, circa 1988.”<br><br>“Ah.”<br><br>“Are you hiding?”<br><br>“Only in plain sight.”<br><br>“What keeps you here, then?”<br><br>“Nothing does. You find me here because nothing keeps me elsewhere.”<br><br>“My native tour is looking really promising at this point,” she said, with mock exasperation.<br><br>“We can sit and talk. I’d like that.” He surprised himself. He turned his body, just enough to guide her to the left, toward the entrance to the Swissôtel. “Here, they’ll call a cab for us in the lobby.”<br><br>“Fuck it. Let’s check out their bar. I don’t need texture, I need air-conditioning.”<br><br>Inside, they plumped themselves in a vacant corner of the Swissôtel’s modern lounge and ordered iced coffees from the waitress. Tira texted Stolarsky their location, then placed her smartphone on the table between them, but it lay dark. Bruno eased himself back in the booth, pleasantly abstracted, faintly turned on, hovering in a benign cloud of non-urgencies.<br><br>Tira said, “Look at this.” She tugged at her neckline to show a fresh sunburn between her collar and where she bulged from her red brassiere. “I walked out yesterday without any sunblock. I’ve been using it pretty religiously, but I figured I could afford fifteen minutes—guess again. The advertising campaign for this place should be: Too impatient to wait another hundred years for the global-warming apocalypse? Try Singapore!”<br><br>“You don’t feature a lot of natural defense.”<br><br>“No,” she said, touching her flesh.<br><br>People delivered themselves, helplessly, if you gave them the chance. It was to Bruno a matter of permanent wonder, though he seldom knew whether to be bored or enthralled. And yet she never quite got to the point. Few did, without help.<br><br>“Are you two really sex tourists?” Bruno asked. “Or some kind of swingers?”<br><br>“Har!” Her laugh was a seal bark.<br><br>“What?” To himself, he already sounded defensive.<br><br>“It’s just that where I come from, by which I mean the Bay Area and the twentieth century, we use the term ‘open relationship.’ And if you’d asked me in so many words, I’d have had to say, *Sure*, *maybe sometimes*, *I guess*. Keith does pretty much what he wants, which I deal with in my various ways. But I’m certainly no swinger, Alexander. I’m not sure I’ve ever even met a certified authentic swinger, not by that name. Christ, this stuff is like maple syrup.” Tira had swigged half an iced coffee, set down by the waitress during the course of her monologue.<br><br>“They don’t know any other way,” he said. “And no offense intended.”<br><br>She barked again. “It’s cool, Keith has been accused of plenty worse than sex tourism! So have I, just for being in his general range of operations.”<br><br>Operations? It struck Bruno as an odd word. “What’s the source of all his money?”<br><br>“Are you pulling my leg? When did you last see each other?”<br><br>“Not since high school.”<br><br>“But you must have come back through Berkeley in the last, uh, thirty or so years, right?”<br><br>“Not once.” It was probably as near to a distinctive accomplishment as he could claim in his life. A slow-forming, barely perceived performance-art piece: “Alexander Unreturning (1981–Present, Found Materials).”<br><br>“I guess that’s what it would take not to know. Keith owns about half of Telegraph Avenue. You know Zodiac Media, right?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“The superstore? Electronics, games, T-shirts, all that garbage? Or Zombie Burger?”<br><br>“No. Neither.”<br><br>“Well, those are his stores. The source of the dough, since you asked. Keith’s empire takes up a chunk of what used to be, you know, head shops and used-book stores and Afghan tabouli joints, all that good old Berkeley shit.”<br><br>Bruno shrugged. She looked at him oddly.<br><br>“I’m not confused—you did grow up there, right?”<br><br>“I moved to Berkeley with my mother when I was six. We’d lived in Marin County before that.”<br><br>“So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<br><br>Tira’s question was obvious, even if she couldn’t put it in words. It was Bruno’s to answer or duck. It was only his old habit he needed to overcome, that of pretending his Berkeley childhood belonged to someone other than his present self.<br><br>“I don’t know whether my mother is alive or dead,” he said. “Though I’d be surprised if there’s much left of her. She fled the affections of her guru in San Rafael, as I said, when I was six. Her idea was to lay low in Berkeley, let the drugs wear off over time, but she was in poor shape already. I mean, mentally.”<br><br>“And Keith said you worked at Chez Panisse? When you were in high school?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Then you just, what, ran away from home?”<br><br>“I wasn’t living at home by then. June couldn’t maintain a home or anything else. She was in a city shelter, except I’d see her quite a bit at People’s Park, too, living in a rather&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feral manner.”<br><br>“I’m sorry.”<br><br>“I don’t think of it that way.”<br><br>“You lived at the shelter?”<br><br>“I farmed myself out to some friends’ spare rooms, restaurant people, waiters and so forth. It was a thing you could do in Berkeley back then.”<br><br>“So you were, like, the most legendary teen-ager ever. I can’t believe Keith never told me that part.”<br><br>“Keith wouldn’t have had even the slightest suspicion.”<br><br>“Because you were, what—already too cool for school, nobody’s fool, and dressing like Peter O’Toole? I’m writing a poem about you, if you hadn’t noticed.”<br><br>Tira’s phone pulsed on the glass tabletop. She grabbed it and read. “Here he comes now. Will he ever be pissed he missed out on your confession.”<br><br>It was absurd that the thought of Keith Stolarsky’s learning about June, decades later and a continent distant from Berkeley, should feel like a noose tightening. “Please, let him think there was some cost, that it didn’t come spilling out so easily. I have a reputation to uphold.”<br><br>“Maybe I waterboarded you? Or—” Tira put fist to lips and tongue-ballooned her cheek from within, miming fellatio.<br><br>“Watch yourself,” Bruno said, trying to cover his surprise. “That type of sign language might be illegal in Singapore.”<br><br>“What’s a horny deaf girl to do? I was going to suggest *chew gum*, but then I remembered.” Tira had hit the accelerator, as if frantic, at the prospect of Keith’s arrival, to confirm her mastery of innuendo.<br><br>Keith Stolarsky waddled across the lobby and joined them, and the banter ended, as if dropped off a cliff. Along with it went the confessional atmosphere and the raw sexual taunting, each of which had floated just beneath the banter, fronds in a murky pool. Bruno had rarely been so easily disarranged. But Stolarsky seemed uninterested in what they might have done in his absence.<br><br>“O.K., you fucker, I’m going to eat your lunch.”<br><br>“You want lunch?” Bruno asked.<br><br>“Sure, but that’s not what I’m talking about. We’re gonna play backgammon tonight, or this afternoon, as soon as you’re ready. I want to see if you can surprise me.”<br><br>Bruno had seen men pronounce themselves instantaneous players before, gripped by a fever upon discovering that high-stakes backgammon existed, and captured by the romance Bruno represented, wishing to climb into his skin.<br><br>Tira, meanwhile, said nothing. She’d receded joylessly behind Stolarsky, a moon. Bruno had realized the startling sweetness of their exchange at the last instant, like the condensed milk at the bottom of his glass, which crept between his lips only after he’d drained the black coffee above.<br><br>Bruno stopped by Edgar Falk’s rooms for a drink that evening, before making his second visit to Raffles.<br><br>He had spent the afternoon in his own hotel in a deep slumber, after the unsatisfying encounter with Tira and Stolarsky. He’d slept dreamlessly but woke into melancholy. A nap ending precisely at sunset, with its undead overtones, was rarely a good idea. In fact, Bruno realized as he waited for the butler to open the door to Falk’s rooms, he *had* dreamed, not of a situation, or of a lost person or place, but merely of an image. Bruno had dreamed a reverse sunset, a black sunset.<br><br>The black sun had been haloed in purple, sinking against a field of yellow. In his dream he’d watched it sink below its horizon, only to abruptly re-center in his field of vision and begin its lonely plummet again. It was this that had brought the profound melancholy upon him.<br><br>Falk’s Singaporean “butler” was a houseboy, really, supplied by the hotel but soon usurped to Falk’s local purposes. He served Falk with a deference that suggested a wholesale blindness to vice, and he was present for any number of untaxed transfers of Singapore dollars, among other dubiously legal exhibitions. Falk conducted an invisible orchestra of graft; his mantra was “price of doing business.” In Southeast Asia, particularly, Falk held off the incursion of officials and mobsters on Bruno’s delicate operations, such as closing maneuvers on a drunken rich man who’d agreed to a double-or-nothing match on a debt that had grown outrageous. While Bruno departed his hotel to the airport, to evaporate into a new locale, Falk stayed behind to settle affairs and collect debts.<br><br>“Mister Edgar is massage,” the butler said.<br><br>“He asked me to come by. I can wait, or come back—”<br><br>“No, he want you come in.”<br><br>Of course he did. Falk seemed to relish exposure of his nudity to Bruno, and to others who came in range, in steam rooms or at private swimming pools, anywhere such a display could be managed. Showing his crumbling flesh, Falk appropriated time’s power as his own, needling younger men with what they must inevitably become. *If I can take it*, *you*’*d better*. As Bruno stepped past the butler and entered Falk’s dimmed bedroom, he smelled saffron. Falk was stretched face down on the table, a towel draped to conceal his sallow buttocks. A Malay masseuse kneaded the loose, brown-flecked, papery skin covering Falk’s shoulder blades. She lowered her eyes from Bruno’s.<br><br>“Alexander.” Falk didn’t raise his head. His groan rose sepulchrally from within the cushioned doughnut that concealed his face.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I had coffee with Billy Lim. He apologized for last night. He said he’d been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unavoidably detained.” No doubt Falk and Lim had been talking over their pet project, the fixed soccer match.<br><br>“Elusive fellow.”<br><br>“Worth indulging, I think. We’ve made an arrangement for Friday night.”<br><br>“Sounds serious.”<br><br>“I hope so. He told me he once won a Bengal tiger in a poker game with the director of the Singapore Zoo.”<br><br>“Travels everywhere with him now, this tiger?”<br><br>“Billy ate him, for strength.” Falk sighed, as if the massage had eased the words from him. The masseuse had slung Falk’s elbow over her shoulder, exposing his white-sprigged underarm as she mashed her thumbs deep into the sockets of his shoulder.<br><br>Bruno had no clue whether the eaten tiger was a garish boast or a witticism of Lim’s. It was time, anyhow, to quit stalling. “Listen, Edgar, I’ve had no chance to tell you. Much to my surprise, I’m actually in a game *tonight,* with that American who wandered in.”<br><br>“Your ancestral friend. Yes, I know.”<br><br>So Falk had heard. The butler? The masseuse? He likely knew it from a dozen sources.<br><br>“It’s a good thing Billy Lim didn’t want to play tonight, isn’t it?”<br><br>“I wasn’t concealing it from you.”<br><br>“I know.”<br><br>“It came as a surprise.” Bruno was repeating himself.<br><br>“I’m sure it did. Action?”<br><br>“I think there’ll be action. He doesn’t look it, but he’s a rich man, apparently.”<br><br>“Retail, I gather.” Now the masseuse applied a dust or powder of some sort to Falk’s limbs. Predictably, the towel was removed for full access. “You’d rather I wasn’t there.”<br><br>“It wouldn’t matter one way or another, to me, Edgar. But I don’t think it’s what Keith has in mind. You’re cut in, of course—”<br><br>“Say nothing more.”<br><br>Bruno had been dismissed. To underline it, Falk farted and exhaled wheezily, like a body slackening in death. Whatever bound the two men—it included affection—had long since outworn the illusions of pride. The old jackal faced the young one in a merciless mirror.<br><br>An hour later, Bruno appeared at Raffles. He’d dressed informally, in a white suit appropriate to the hot night, and carried his backgammon set under his arm. The staff welcomed him, their wheels greased.<br><br>They directed him to the door of the Straits Settlement Suite.<br><br>Stolarsky was in grotty black lounge shorts and a San Francisco 49ers jersey, its red-and-gold emblem laminated, not stitched. His white robe and slippers were presumably courtesy of Raffles. Despite the slick, fussy Victorian décor, Stolarsky’s presence reduced the suite to a bug’s lair, as if by opening the door Bruno had lifted a rock. The act of entering, which Bruno did now, became a matter of shrinking oneself to size, of joining the flea circus. The lamps illuminated little piles of travel receipts, wadded-up currency, other detritus. The door to the bedroom was closed.<br><br>inset-left<br><br>[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b67baedb25442b234e839]<br><br>“She’s sleeping already?”<br><br>“Nah, she’s out trolling around with this bored Kansas City housewife she met at the bar. Told me to tell you she’d come by at some point, but I think she’s kinda pissed off I’m not dedicating our last night to showing her the night life. Cool, you brought your set. I been doing nothing but playing online. I feel like someone poured Drano in my eye sockets.”<br><br>“Your last night?”<br><br>“Yeah, we moved up our ticket. Got sick of this shit in a hurry. I don’t know how you stand it.”<br><br>“It’s the same to me as any other place.”<br><br>“O.K., Magister Ludi, I read you. You see nothing beyond the horizon of the board. Now I’m going to clamber into your minimalist Zen-master rock garden and we’ll see if I can muss your hair a little.”<br><br>“I really have no idea what you’re talking about. May I fix myself a drink?”<br><br>“Your secret garden, your enclosure of enigma. The arena in which you pilot your fickle finger of backgammon fate. I’m calling your bluff, old sport, old *pip*, old *cock*. Make me one of those while you’re at it.”<br><br>Bruno splashed Macallan into two tumblers and said, “Backgammon isn’t a bluffing game.”<br><br>“Hey, leave room for ice. What about the doubling cube? You’re just softening me up, you fucking hustler.”<br><br>“I wouldn’t ice this. Doubling isn’t the same as bluffing—both players can see the entire board.”<br><br>“Right, you wouldn’t ice good Scotch, of course not. Anyhow, I don’t mean bluffing about shit hidden on the board, Alexander. I mean bluffing about what’s in your *mind*.”<br><br>Stolarsky grinned and raised the Scotch in a silent toast.<br><br>“I’m an open book,” Bruno said. “Shall we get started?”<br><br>By the time of the first interruption, Bruno had concluded that Stolarsky’s game, cobbled though it might be from Internet research and contests with programs, or with players hidden behind their own screens, was not too shabby. Stolarsky displayed a spongy intelligence and wasn’t stuck on one or another principle of play at the expense of what the dice commanded. Still, Bruno won five of the seven games, and he amused himself by never touching the cube, to Stolarsky’s bedevilment. It denied Stolarsky any cue as to when he ought to resign.<br><br>“I don’t get it, why don’t you double me?” Stolarsky said during the eighth game, when put on the bar. Stolarsky had already doubled, as on two previous occasions. Bruno accepted any of Stolarsky’s doubles as a matter of policy. It was a way to needle the new player, to learn what he was made of. Bruno had insisted they begin at stakes of a hundred per point. They could build from there, or not. He was up eight hundred as it was.<br><br>In answer now, Bruno just shrugged.<br><br>“Are you saying I’ve still got a shot here? I don’t see it.”<br><br>“One always has a shot.”<br><br>“You’re toying with me again.”<br><br>“Resign if you like.”<br><br>“Chuck you, Farley.” Stolarsky rolled. As if the dice had conspired with Bruno to educate Stolarsky in the caprice of their possibilities, Stolarsky reëntered from the bar on his first try, and also hit Bruno’s sole uncovered checker.<br><br>“There you go,” Bruno said.<br><br>“Guess you saw that coming.” Stolarsky meant it sarcastically, but he was unable to hide his satisfaction at the turn of his luck, a loser’s hunger for the flavor denied him.<br><br>“No, but I’ve seen it happen before.”<br><br>“I’m not letting you off the hook, Flashman. Roll.”<br><br>Bruno managed to lose, though not before accepting a double from Stolarsky, which he beavered, pointlessly. The result brought them close to equilibrium, Bruno just four hundred up after an hour of play. A gentleman’s game, therefore a total snooze. Stolarsky’s monomaniacal focus on the checkers had drained off the chaotic intensity of his other behaviors.<br><br>“I’m not really interesting you, am I?” Stolarsky swirled a mouthful of Macallan as if it were mouthwash, then grimaced, and worked his bared teeth with the tip of his tongue.<br><br>“Not enormously.”<br><br>“Ah, most delicately put. What would float your boat, Mr. Enormously?”<br><br>“Five hundred a point might keep me from falling asleep.”<br><br>“That’s the spirit, and if falling asleep is an issue there’s more than one approach to that problem.” Stolarsky threw a die to open the game.<br><br>“A pot of coffee?”<br><br>“Fuck coffee. I got something better, which I need to use up before the plane, anyhow.”<br><br>They sniffed the cocaine off a marble side table, after moving the lamp to the carpet. The lowered lamp, its shade atilt, threw goonish shadows, revealing the room’s chaos—Stolarsky’s shed robe flung across the arm of the sofa, ice cubes melting on the countertop. Stolarsky, despite the Raffles’s mellow A.C., seemed to be facing some kind of internal thermostatic crisis; grumbling over the dice and the checkers, he mopped sweat from temples and brow with his sleeves. At five hundred a point, the battle was properly joined. Stolarsky won twice before Bruno cracked him again, the sweating man playing at the very edge of his capacity, a capacity expanding before Bruno’s eyes. Bruno doubled Stolarsky out of the next few games, but not before Stolarsky miscalculated, doubling back foolishly, to a penalty of four thousand dollars.<br><br>“All right all right all right,” Stolarsky incanted, shoving the checkers back to their starting points.<br><br>“There’s no hurry.”<br><br>“Oh, there’s a hurry. You keeping count of all the dough I’m losing to you?”<br><br>“I won’t lose track.”<br><br>“Thattaboy, Flash. I’m sure you’re just as diligent a counter when you’re losing.”<br><br>“I suppose I might be. I wouldn’t know.”<br><br>“Roll, fucker.”<br><br>Bruno had gone back for another line. The cocaine stretched the parameters of the room, and also Bruno’s skull. A chasm had revealed itself, between his eyes and the board, and between his brain and his eyes.<br><br>“Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fuck&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there?”<br><br>Either Stolarsky’s voice had slowed or Bruno’s attentions were revving. Stolarsky’s inquiry wasn’t totally naïve: Bruno had hit a lone back checker on the one-point, with nothing but his five-point covered. Only double fives would keep Stolarsky out—on any other number he’d either hit Bruno in return or gain ground.<br><br>“Has no one in your online support group mentioned ‘tempo play’?”<br><br>“See, now that’s a question I wanted to ask you: Why does all backgammon nomenclature sound like ‘The Kama Sutra’? It’s like sex code.”<br><br>“The explanation is obvious. Intercourse was invented one day by a couple of bored backgammon players. They simply used the language that was available to them.”<br><br>“You got a weird sense of humor, Flashman. God damn it, I’m going to lose this race, aren’t I?”<br><br>Bruno shrugged. “Roll your dice and see.” He did wonder a little, at the strange expansion his personality underwent in Stolarsky’s presence. He bore off the first of his checkers, and Stolarsky threw up his hands in disgust.<br><br>“You should double me so I can resign.”<br><br>“I choose not to.”<br><br>“I resign anyway.”<br><br>“Why not race?”<br><br>“Because I fucking lost.”<br><br>The women came through the door. Tira Harpaz and Cynthia Jalter, that was the name she gave, the couples therapist from Kansas City who’d attended not the same high school as Tira, no, but whose school had played field hockey against hers and wasn’t it funny, here they were, the four of them not *exactly* but *almost* two pairs of high-school friends, in a palatial hotel in Singapore, while Cynthia Jalter’s husband, Richard, a probate lawyer and a cold fish—Cynthia Jalter could use some couples therapy herself!—snoozed downstairs. Tira and Cynthia enjoyed some cocaine, and all this information came tumbling out.<br><br>“So how bad is it going to get?” Tira said. “Keith gonna have to sell the Jag?” The women snorted and giggled together, rolling on the couch in hilarity. Maybe Cynthia’s presence brought out the garrulous Midwesterner in Tira, or Tira was drunk—well, she was—or drunk on the conviviality with a woman. Bruno didn’t know Tira well enough to say, never mind how he’d begun consorting with her in his thoughts.<br><br>“He’s a decent player,” Bruno said. “We’re still just feeling each other out.”<br><br>“Oh, fucking fantastic, you’re *feeling each other out!* You find anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hard?” Now the women screeched. “&nbsp;’Cause we’ve been out feeling around for that ourselves, but *no cigar* is sometimes just *no cigar*—”<br><br>Tira launched herself from the couch in an attempt to perch in Stolarsky’s lap, in doing so jarring the board, as she pushed herself between it and Stolarsky. Checkers were sent clattering—fortunately not a position in progress, only a game set to play. Stolarsky widened his knees and let her tumble to the carpet.<br><br>“Hey!”<br><br>“Chill out.”<br><br>“Oh, I get it, you wanted me *down here*.” She knelt between Stolarsky’s knees and tugged at the waistband of his lounge shorts. He clapped his hand over hers.<br><br>“Quit, Tira.”<br><br>“I’m just *feeling you out*.”<br><br>Cynthia Jalter draped her arms over Bruno’s shoulders, from behind. “She told me you looked like James Bond, but I didn’t believe it,” she stage-whispered.<br><br>“Now, see, that’s just *outstandingly* stupid,” Stolarsky said. He brushed Tira’s hands from him and began restoring the checkers to their right points. “Because James Bond has been played by, like, twelve different actors at this point, so he doesn’t look like anything, except a *default masculine blur*. Which I guess is what you’re getting with Alexander here.”<br><br>Nothing made enough sense to matter. Even though Bruno had found Cynthia Jalter’s peroxided hair and jowly, excessively rouged face decidedly unattractive, her arms, and her heavy chest, didn’t feel in any way terrible against his shoulders. He marvelled at his twenty-four-hour descent, from that first disquieting glimpse of Stolarsky in the Smoker’s Club to this homely immersion in Americana-style cocktail-hour debauchery. Bruno had never visited Missouri, but he felt he might be there now.<br><br>They were seven or ten moves into a game to which he’d barely attended when he found himself with three of Stolarsky’s men on the bar and his tongue down Cynthia Jalter’s throat. At that proximity, he could see nothing at all wrong with her face, though it seemed possible that she might suction his tongue from its root.<br><br>“You’re patronizing me,” Stolarsky said. “Take my fucking money when it’s there on the table.”<br><br>“I’m a little distracted—”<br><br>“Here, I’ll put the doubling cube down her fucking shirt where you can find it.”<br><br>“*Mmmmghh-um*—” Cynthia Jalter unpeeled her face from his long enough to say, “Take his money, baby, it’s what we’re all here to see. I’m not going aaanywhere.” To prove this, she bent and began addressing his neck.<br><br>“Yeah, Alexander,” Tira added, “for fuck’s sake, put him out of his misery.”<br><br>“O.K., I double you.”<br><br>“And I accept. Roll the dice.”<br><br>“Why why why would you do that?” Tira asked Stolarsky.<br><br>“It’s called *recirculation*, sweetheart, it’s called a *back game*, so keep your kibbitzing to yourself.”<br><br>“It wouldn’t be kibbitzing if I did.”<br><br>“Back game?” Cynthia Jalter gasped, coming up for air. “I haven’t gotten into one of those in a long time. Maybe tonight’ll be the night.”<br><br>“You play backgammon?” Bruno said.<br><br>The others all found this hilarious.<br><br>In the taxicab en route to Billy Yik Tho Lim’s residence in Sentosa Cove, a passing car flooded the back seat with light and Edgar Falk leaned in and scrutinized Bruno’s neck.<br><br>“Driver, would you give us the light?” Falk said.<br><br>“What?” Bruno said, rubbing at the spot. “A mosquito bite?” Then it occurred to him what had drawn Falk’s attention.<br><br>“A blemish. Keep still.” Falk reached into his interior jacket pocket and produced a small vial, which he opened to reveal a chamois pad drenched in greasy, flesh-colored powder.<br><br>“You’re putting makeup on my *neck*?”<br><br>“That I am doing, yes.”<br><br>“I can’t believe you even carry that around with you.”<br><br>“You’ll find yourself wanting to be prepared sooner or later, Alexander. It’s a situation that comes with age.” If Falk recognized that the bluish mark on Bruno’s throat was a hickey—he did, of course—he said nothing. Instead, he gazed out the window. “I am getting older, you know.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I could retire here,” Falk mused. “I like it. Sentosa Cove in particular.”<br><br>“Now?”<br><br>Falk didn’t speak.<br><br>In the end, Bruno’s and Cynthia Jalter’s clothes had stayed on. She’d merely barnacled to his neck and gripped his cock through his pants while he lost the last six games in a row to Keith Stolarsky, whether willfully or not, Bruno couldn’t tell, but he let Stolarsky double him out of each of them and as a result gave back many thousands of the Singapore dollars he’d won, and with relief. Bruno didn’t want to take Stolarsky for too much, he couldn’t say why. He’d lost the last six and then begged off. The cocaine was gone, leaving a hole in the center of his attention, of his sight. There, with Stolarsky, had come the official start of the losing streak, unrecognized by Bruno.<br><br>He had got out without looking Tira Harpaz in the eye, and that, in the end, was what had seemed to matter most.<br><br>At the Sentosa Cove beach house, it wasn’t until nearly one in the morning, when Bruno was already more than a hundred thousand in the hole, that Billy Yik Tho Lim said anything about the mark on Bruno’s neck. Either Bruno had sweated off the makeup Falk had applied or he’d rubbed at the mark in some unconscious nervous action. Or perhaps Lim had spied it from the start but delayed mentioning what he saw. Lim wore a pistol he never removed, which made two in the room, or two visible, since his bodyguard wore one as well. Bruno imagined how human screams could be covered by the surf’s roar and then decided he was being silly.<br><br>“Your luck is no good,” Lim had said at first, making no direct reference to the hickey. The former secret-police director’s English was governmentally genteel, but with a blunt overtone.<br><br>“Not at the moment,” Bruno admitted.<br><br>“You shouldn’t have played tonight,” Lim said, grinning. “You been kissed by an octopus.” It was then that he pointed at Bruno’s neck.<br><br>Two hours later, after too few good turns and very many worse ones, Edgar Falk’s entire stake was gone.&nbsp;♦<br><br>
