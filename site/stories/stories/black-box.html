What do you think about that?” suggests a preference for direct verbal responses over giggling.<br><br>“I like it” must be uttered with enough gusto to compensate for a lack of declarative color.<br><br>“You don’t sound sure” indicates insufficient gusto.<br><br>“I’m *not* sure” is acceptable only when followed, coyly, with “You’ll have to convince me.”<br><br>Throwing back your head and closing your eyes allows you to give the appearance of sexual readiness while concealing revulsion.<br><br>## 7<br>Being alone with a violent and ruthless man, surrounded by water, can make the shore seem very far away.<br><br>You may feel solidarity, at such a time, with the beauties just visible there in their bright bikinis.<br><br>You may appreciate, at such a time, why you aren’t being paid for this work.<br><br>Your voluntary service is the highest form of patriotism.<br><br>Remind yourself that you aren’t being paid when he climbs out of the water and lumbers toward you.<br><br>Remind yourself that you aren’t being paid when he leads you behind a boulder and pulls you onto his lap.<br><br>The Dissociation Technique is like a parachute—you must pull the cord at the correct time.<br><br>Too soon, and you may hinder your ability to function at a crucial moment;<br><br>Too late, and you will be lodged too deeply inside the action to wriggle free.<br><br>You will be tempted to pull the cord when he surrounds you with arms whose bulky strength reminds you, fleetingly, of your husband’s.<br><br>You will be tempted to pull it when you feel him start to move against you from below.<br><br>You will be tempted to pull it when his smell envelops you: metallic, like a warm hand clutching pennies.<br><br>The directive “Relax” suggests that your discomfort is palpable.<br><br>“No one can see us” suggests that your discomfort has been understood as fear of physical exposure.<br><br>“Relax, relax,” uttered in rhythmic, throaty tones, suggests that your discomfort is not unwelcome.<br><br>## 8<br>Begin the Dissociation Technique only when physical violation is imminent.<br><br>Close your eyes and slowly count backward from ten.<br><br>With each number, imagine yourself rising out of your body and moving one step farther away from it.<br><br>By eight, you should be hovering just outside your skin.<br><br>By five, you should be floating a foot or two above your body, feeling only vague anxiety over what is about to happen to it.<br><br>By three, you should feel fully detached from your physical self.<br><br>By two, your body should be able to act and react without your participation.<br><br>By one, your mind should drift so free that you lose track of what is happening below.<br><br>White clouds spin and curl.<br><br>A blue sky is as depthless as the sea.<br><br>The sound of waves against rocks existed millennia before there were creatures who could hear it.<br><br>Spurs and gashes of stone narrate a violence that the earth itself has long forgotten.<br><br>Your mind will rejoin your body when it is safe to do so.<br><br>## 9<br>Return to your body carefully, as if you were reëntering your home after a hurricane.<br><br>Resist the impulse to reconstruct what has just happened.<br><br>Focus instead on gauging your Designated Mate’s reaction to the new intimacy between you.<br><br>In some men, intimacy will prompt a more callous, indifferent attitude.<br><br>In others, intimacy may awaken problematic curiosity about you.<br><br>“Where did you learn to swim like that?,” uttered lazily, while supine, with two fingers in your hair, indicates curiosity.<br><br>Tell the truth without precision.<br><br>“I grew up near a lake” is both true and vague.<br><br>“Where was the lake?” conveys dissatisfaction with your vagueness.<br><br>“Columbia County, New York” suggests precision while avoiding it.<br><br>“Manhattan?” betrays unfamiliarity with the geography of New York State.<br><br>Never contradict your Designated Mate.<br><br>“Where did *you* grow up?,” asked of a man who has just asked you the same thing, is known as “mirroring.”<br><br>Mirror your Designated Mate’s attitudes, interests, desires, and tastes.<br><br>Your goal is to become part of his atmosphere: a source of comfort and ease.<br><br>Only then will he drop his guard when you are near.<br><br>Only then will he have significant conversations within your earshot.<br><br>Only then will he leave his possessions in a porous and unattended state.<br><br>Only then can you begin to gather information systematically.<br><br>## 10<br>“Come. Let’s go back,” uttered brusquely, suggests that your Designated Mate has no more wish to talk about himself than you do.<br><br>Avoid the temptation to analyze his moods and whims.<br><br>Salt water has a cleansing effect.<br><br>## 11<br>You will see knowledge of your new intimacy with your Designated Mate in the eyes of every beauty on shore.<br><br>“We saved lunch for you” may or may not be an allusion to the reason for your absence.<br><br>Cold fish is unappealing, even when served in a good lemon sauce.<br><br>Be friendly to other beauties, but not solicitous.<br><br>When you are in conversation with a beauty, it is essential that you be perceived as no more or less than she is.<br><br>Be truthful about every aspect of your life except marriage (if any).<br><br>If married, say that you and your spouse have divorced, to give an impression of unfettered freedom.<br><br>“Oh, that’s sad!” suggests that the beauty you’re chatting with would like to marry. you’re chatting with would like to marry.<br><br>## 12<br>If your Designated Mate abruptly veers toward the villa, follow him.<br><br>Taking his hand and smiling congenially can create a sense of low-key accompaniment.<br><br>An abstracted smile in return, as if he’d forgotten who you are, may be a sign of pressing concerns.<br><br>The concerns of your Designated Mate are your concerns.<br><br>The room assigned to a powerful man will be more lavish than the one you slept in while awaiting his arrival.<br><br>Never look for hidden cameras: the fact that you’re looking will give you away.<br><br>Determine whether your Designated Mate seeks physical intimacy; if not, feign the wish for a nap.<br><br>Your pretense of sleep will allow him to feel that he is alone.<br><br>Curling up under bedclothes, even those belonging to an enemy subject, may be soothing.<br><br>You’re more likely to hear his handset vibrate if your eyes are closed.<br><br>## 13<br>A door sliding open signals his wish to take the call on the balcony.<br><br>Your Designated Mate’s important conversations will take place outdoors.<br><br>If you are within earshot of his conversation, record it.<br><br>Since beauties carry neither pocketbooks nor timepieces, you cannot credibly transport recording devices.<br><br>A microphone has been implanted just beyond the first turn of your right ear canal.<br><br>Activate the microphone by pressing the triangle of cartilage across your ear opening.<br><br>You will hear a faint whine as recording begins.<br><br>In extreme quiet, or to a person whose head is adjacent to yours, this whine may be audible.<br><br>Should the whine be detected, swat your ear as if to deflect a mosquito, hitting the on/off cartilage to deactivate the mike.<br><br>You need not identify or comprehend the language your subject is using.<br><br>Your job is proximity; if you are near your Designated Mate, recording his private speech, you are succeeding.<br><br>Profanity sounds the same in every language.<br><br>An angry subject will guard his words less carefully.<br><br>## 14<br>If your subject is angry, you may leave your camouflage position and move as close to him as possible to improve recording quality.<br><br>You may feel afraid as you do this.<br><br>Your pounding heartbeat will not be recorded.<br><br>If your Designated Mate is standing on a balcony, hover in the doorway just behind him.<br><br>If he pivots and discovers you, pretend that you were on the verge of approaching him.<br><br>Anger usually trumps suspicion.<br><br>If your subject brushes past you and storms out of the room, slamming the door, you have eluded detection.<br><br>## 15<br>If your Designated Mate leaves your company a second time, don’t follow him again.<br><br>Deactivate your ear mike and resume your “nap.”<br><br>A moment of repose may be a good time to reassure your loved ones.<br><br>Nuanced communication is too easily monitored by the enemy.<br><br>Your Subcutaneous Pulse System issues pings so generic that detection would reveal neither source nor intent.<br><br>A button is embedded behind the inside ligament of your right knee (if right-handed).<br><br>Depress twice to indicate to loved ones that you are well and thinking of them.<br><br>You may send this signal only once each day.<br><br>A continuous depression of the button indicates an emergency.<br><br>You will debate, each day, the best time to send your signal.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that your husband, coming from a culture of tribal allegiance, understands and applauds your patriotism.<br><br>You will reflect on the enclosed and joyful life that the two of you have shared since graduate school.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that America is your husband’s chosen country, and that he loves it.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that your husband’s rise to prominence would have been unimaginable in any other nation.<br><br>You will reflect on your joint conviction that your service had to be undertaken before you had children.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that you are thirty-three, and have spent your professional life fomenting musical trends.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that you must return home the same person you were when you left.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that you’ve been guaranteed you will *not* be the same person.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that you had stopped being that person even before leaving.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that too much reflection is pointless.<br><br>You will reflect on the fact that these “instructions” are becoming less and less instructive.<br><br>Your Field Instructions, stored in a chip beneath your hairline, will serve as both a mission log and a guide for others undertaking this work.<br><br>Pressing your left thumb (if right-handed) against your left middle fingertip begins recording.<br><br>For clearest results, mentally speak the thought, as if talking to yourself.<br><br>Always filter your observations and experience through the lens of their didactic value.<br><br>Your training is ongoing; you must learn from each step you take.<br><br>When your mission is complete, you may view the results of the download before adding your Field Instructions to your mission file.<br><br>Where stray or personal thoughts have intruded, you may delete them.<br><br>## 16<br>Pretend sleep can lead to actual sleep.<br><br>Sleep is restorative in almost every circumstance.<br><br>The sound of showering likely indicates the return of your Designated Mate.<br><br>As a beauty, you will be expected to return to your room and change clothes often; a fresh appearance at mealtimes is essential.<br><br>The goal is to be a lovely, innocuous, evolving surprise.<br><br>A crisp white sundress against tanned skin is widely viewed as attractive.<br><br>Avoid overbright colors; they are attention-seeking and hinder camouflage.<br><br>White is not, technically speaking, a bright color.<br><br>White is, nevertheless, bright.<br><br>Gold spike-heeled sandals may compromise your ability to run or jump, but they look good on tanned feet.<br><br>Thirty-three is still young enough to register as “young.”<br><br>Registering as “young” is especially welcome to those who may not register as “young” much longer.<br><br>If your Designated Mate leads you to dinner with an arm at your waist, assume that your attire change was successful.<br><br>## 17<br>When men begin serious talk, beauties are left to themselves.<br><br>“How long have you been divorced?” suggests the wish to resume a prior conversation.<br><br>“A few months,” when untrue, should be uttered without eye contact.<br><br>“What was he like, your husband?” may be answered honestly.<br><br>“From Africa. Kenya” will satisfy your wish to talk about your husband.<br><br>“Black?,” with eyebrows raised, may indicate racism.<br><br>“Yes. Black,” in measured tones, should deliver a gentle reprimand.<br><br>“How black?” suggests that it did not.<br><br>“Very black” is somewhat less gentle, especially when accompanied by a pointed stare.<br><br>“Nice” hints at personal experience.<br><br>“Yes. It is nice” contradicts one’s alleged divorce. “Was nice” is a reasonable correction.<br><br>“But not nice enough?,” with laughter, indicates friendly intimacy. Especially when followed by “Or too nice!”<br><br>## 18<br>House-party hosts are universally eager to make guests eat.<br><br>For most beauties, the lure of food is a hazard; as a beauty of limited tenure, you may eat what you want.<br><br>Squab can be consumed by ripping the bird apart with your hands and sucking the meat from the bones.<br><br>A stunned expression reveals that your host expected the use of utensils.<br><br>A host who caters to violent guests will understand implicitly the need for discretion.<br><br>The adjacency of your host’s chair to your own may presage a confidence.<br><br>If your job is to appear simpleminded, a confidence may mean that you have failed.<br><br>Everyone should brush his teeth before dinner.<br><br>Turning your ear toward your host’s mouth will prevent you from having to smell the breath coming from it.<br><br>Ears must be kept clean at all times.<br><br>If your host warns you that your Designated Mate may pose an immediate danger to you, assume that your Designated Mate has left the room.<br><br>## 19<br>Going to the rest room is the most efficient means of self-jettisoning.<br><br>Never betray urgency, not even in an empty hallway.<br><br>If you have no idea in which direction your Designated Mate has gone, hold still.<br><br>If you find yourself hovering beside a pair of glass doors, you may open them and step outside.<br><br>Nights in the South of France are a strange, dark, piercing blue.<br><br>A bright moon can astonish, no matter how many times you have seen it.<br><br>If you were a child who loved the moon, looking at the moon will forever remind you of childhood.<br><br>Fatherless girls may invest the moon with a certain paternal promise.<br><br>Everyone has a father.<br><br>A vague story like “Your father died before you were born” may satisfy a curious child for an unlikely number of years.<br><br>The truth of your paternity, discovered in adulthood, will make the lie seem retroactively ludicrous.<br><br>Publicists occasionally have flings with their movie-star clients.<br><br>Discovering that you are a movie star’s daughter is not necessarily a comfort.<br><br>It is especially not a comfort when the star in question has seven other children from three different marriages.<br><br>Discovering that you are a movie star’s daughter may prompt you to watch upward of sixty movies, dating from the beginning of his career.<br><br>You may think, watching said movies, You don’t know about me, but I am here.<br><br>You may think, watching said movies, I’m invisible to you, but I am here.<br><br>A sudden reconfiguration of your past can change the fit and feel of your adulthood.<br><br>It may cleave you, irreparably, from the mother whose single goal has been your happiness.<br><br>If your husband has transformed greatly in his own life, he will understand your transformation.<br><br>Avoid excessive self-reflection; your job is to look out, not in.<br><br>## 20<br>“There you are,” whispered from behind by your Designated Mate, suggests that he has been looking for you.<br><br>Holding still can sometimes prove more effective than actively searching.<br><br>“Come,” uttered softly, may communicate a renewed wish for intimate contact.<br><br>The moon’s calm face can make you feel, in advance, that you are understood and forgiven.<br><br>The sea is audible against the rocks well before you see it.<br><br>Even at night, the Mediterranean is more blue than black.<br><br>If you wish to avoid physical intimacy, the sight of a speedboat will bring relief, despite the myriad new problems it presents.<br><br>If no words are exchanged between your Designated Mate and the speedboat’s captain, their meeting was likely prearranged.<br><br>A man known for his cruelty may still show great care in guiding his beauty into a rocking speedboat.<br><br>He may interpret her hesitation to board as a fear of falling in.<br><br>Resist the impulse to ask where you are going.<br><br>Try, when anxious, to summon up a goofy giggle.<br><br>Locate your Personal Calming Source and use it.<br><br>If your Personal Calming Source is the moon, be grateful that it is dark and that the moon is especially bright.<br><br>Reflect on the many reasons you can’t yet die:<br><br>You need to see your husband.<br><br>You need to have children.<br><br>You need to tell the movie star that he has an eighth child, and that she is a hero.<br><br>## 21<br>The moon may appear to move, but really it is you who are moving.<br><br>At high velocity, a speedboat slams along the tops of waves.<br><br>Fear and excitement are sometimes indistinguishable.<br><br>When the captain of a boat adjusts his course in response to commands from your Designated Mate, he may not know where he is taking you.<br><br>If your Designated Mate keeps looking up, he’s probably using the stars for navigation.<br><br>The Mediterranean is vast enough to have once seemed infinite.<br><br>A beauty should require no more context than the presence of her Designated Mate.<br><br>A beauty must appear to enjoy any journey he initiates.<br><br>Simulate said enjoyment by putting an affectionate arm around him and nestling your head close to his.<br><br>A beauty whose head is aligned with her Designated Mate’s can share in his navigation and thus calculate the route.<br><br>At night, far from shore, stars pulse with a strength that is impossible to conceive of in the proximity of light.<br><br>Your whereabouts will never be a mystery; you will be visible at all times as a dot of light on the screens of those watching over you.<br><br>You are one of hundreds, each a potential hero.<br><br>Technology has afforded ordinary people a chance to glow in the cosmos of human achievement.<br><br>Your lack of espionage and language training is what makes your record clean and neutral.<br><br>You are an ordinary person undertaking an extraordinary task.<br><br>You need not be remarkable for your credentials or skill sets, only for your bravery and equilibrium.<br><br>Knowing that you are one of hundreds shouldn’t feel belittling.<br><br>In the new heroism, the goal is to merge with something larger than yourself.<br><br>In the new heroism, the goal is to throw off generations of self-involvement.<br><br>In the new heroism, the goal is to renounce the American fixation with being seen and recognized.<br><br>In the new heroism, the goal is to dig beneath your shiny persona.<br><br>You’ll be surprised by what lies under it: a rich, deep crawl space of possibilities.<br><br>Some liken this discovery to a dream in which a familiar home acquires new wings and rooms.<br><br>The power of individual magnetism is nothing against the power of combined selfless effort.<br><br>You may accomplish astonishing personal feats, but citizen agents rarely seek individual credit.<br><br>They liken the need for personal glory to cigarette addiction: a habit that feels life-sustaining even as it kills you.<br><br>Childish attention-seeking is usually satisfied at the expense of real power.<br><br>An enemy of the state could not have connived a better way to declaw and distract us.<br><br>Now our notorious narcissism is our camouflage.<br><br>## 22<br>After a juddering ride of several hours, you may not notice at first that the boat is approaching a shore.<br><br>A single lighted structure stands out strongly on a deserted coastline.<br><br>Silence after a roaring motor is a sound of its own.<br><br>The speedboat’s immediate departure signals that you won’t be making a return trip anytime soon.<br><br>Knowing your latitude and longitude is not the same as knowing where you are.<br><br>A new remote and unfamiliar place can make the prior remote and unfamiliar place seem like home.<br><br>Imagining yourself as a dot of light on a screen is oddly reassuring.<br><br>Because your husband is a visionary in the realm of national security, he occasionally has access to that screen.<br><br>If it calms you to imagine your husband tracking your dot of light, then imagine it.<br><br>Do not, however, close your eyes while ascending a rocky path in darkness.<br><br>At Latitude X, Longitude Y, the flora is dry and crumbles under your feet.<br><br>A voice overhead suggests that your arrival was expected and observed.<br><br>An empty shore is not necessarily unpatrolled.<br><br>The best patrols are imperceptible.<br><br>## 23<br>A formal handshake between your new host and your Designated Mate implies that this is their first meeting.<br><br>A formal handshake followed by a complex and stylized hand gesture implies a shared allegiance.<br><br>So does the immediate use of a language you don’t recognize.<br><br>In certain rich, powerful men, physical slightness will seem a source of strength.<br><br>The failure of your new host to acknowledge you may indicate that women do not register in his field of vision.<br><br>Being invisible means that you won’t be closely watched.<br><br>Your job is to be forgotten yet still present.<br><br>A white, sparkling villa amid so much scrabbly darkness will appear miragelike.<br><br>A man to whom women are invisible may still have many beauties in his domain.<br><br>These neglected beauties will vie for his scant attention.<br><br>Among neglected beauties, there is often an alpha beauty who assumes leadership.<br><br>As you enter the house, her cool scrutiny will ripple through the other beauties and surround you.<br><br>The sensation will remind you of going as a child with your mother to visit families with two parents and multiple children.<br><br>At first, the knot of unfamiliar kids would seem impenetrable.<br><br>You would wish, keenly, that you had a sibling who could be your ally.<br><br>Feeling at the mercy of those around you prompted a seismic internal response.<br><br>The will to dominate was deeper than yourself.<br><br>You were never childish, even as a child.<br><br>Your unchildishness is something your husband has always loved in you.<br><br>Once the new children were under your control, it was crushing to leave their midst.<br><br>## 24<br>A small table and chairs carved into a spindly clifftop promontory are doubtless designed for private conversation.<br><br>If your Designated Mate brings you with him to this place, it may mean that he feels less than perfectly at ease with your new host.<br><br>When your new host dismisses his own alpha beauty, important business may be under way.<br><br>An alpha beauty will not tolerate her own exclusion if another beauty is included.<br><br>If your new host makes a motion of dismissal at you, look to your Designated Mate.<br><br>Take orders from no one but your Designated Mate.<br><br>If your Designated Mate keeps an arm around you in the face of your new host’s dismissal, you have become the object of a power play.<br><br>If your new host moves close to your face and speaks directly into it, he is likely testing your ignorance of his language.<br><br>If your Designated Mate stiffens beside you, your new host’s words are probably offensive.<br><br>When you become an object of contention, try to neutralize the conflict.<br><br>A giggle and a look of incomprehension are a beauty’s most reliable tools.<br><br>If the men relax into their chairs, neutralization has been successful.<br><br>Your new host has insulted you and, by extension, your Designated Mate.<br><br>Your Designated Mate has prevailed in his claim that you’re too harmless to bother sending away.<br><br>Congratulate yourself on preserving your adjacency and activate your ear mike.<br><br>## 25<br>In the presence of business conversation, project an utter lack of interest or curiosity.<br><br>Notice where you are at all times.<br><br>On a high, narrow promontory at Latitude X, Longitude Y, the ocean and heavens shimmer in all directions.<br><br>There will be moments in your mission, perhaps very few, when you’ll sense the imminence of critical information.<br><br>It may come in the form of a rush of joy.<br><br>This joy may arise from your discovery that the moon, hard and radiant, is still aloft.<br><br>It may arise from the knowledge that, when your task is complete, you will return to the husband you adore.<br><br>It may arise from the extremity of the natural beauty around you, and the recognition that you are alive in this moment.<br><br>It may arise from your knowledge that you have accomplished every goal you’ve set for yourself since childhood.<br><br>It may arise from the knowledge that at long last you’ve found a goal worthy of your considerable energies.<br><br>It may arise from the knowledge that, by accomplishing this goal, you’ll have helped to perpetuate American life as you know it.<br><br>A wave of joy can make it difficult to sit still.<br><br>Beware of internal states—positive or negative—that obscure what is happening around you.<br><br>When two subjects begin making sketches, concrete planning may have commenced.<br><br>The camera implanted in your left eye is operated by pressing your left tear duct.<br><br>In poor light, a flash may be activated by pressing the outside tip of your left eyebrow.<br><br>When using the flash, always cover your

sheets;<br><br>The smoky earthen smell of the fur of your childhood cat;<br><br>The flavor of the peppermints your mother kept for you inside her desk.<br><br>The impact of a Data Surge may prompt unconsciousness or short-term memory loss.<br><br>The purpose of the red ribbon is to orient you; if you awaken to find yourself clutching one, look to your foot.<br><br>When your body is quiet, unplug the handset and return it to its original location.<br><br>## 36<br>A Data Surge leaves a ringing in your ears that may obscure the sound of another person’s arrival.<br><br>A face that brought you relief once may trigger relief a second time.<br><br>When an alpha beauty accosts you at high volume in an unfamiliar language, it may mean she’s too sleepy to remember who you are.<br><br>It may also mean she’s calling someone else.<br><br>Beauty status will not excuse, for another beauty, your appearance where you are not supposed to be.<br><br>Should you be perceived as an enemy, prepare to defend yourself at the first sign of physical encroachment.<br><br>Your new host lunging at you, shouting, “What the fuck are you doing?,” constitutes physical encroachment.<br><br>Thrust your elbow upward into the tender socket underneath his jaw, sending him backward onto the floor.<br><br>The wails of a newborn will lure its mother away from almost anything, including the physical travails of her mate.<br><br>A man disabled by an elbow blow will have little reaction to infant cries.<br><br>## 37<br>At the revelation of martial-arts expertise, a man who has perceived you as merely a beauty will recalculate your identity and purpose.<br><br>Watch his eyes: he’ll be measuring the distance to his nearest firearm.<br><br>An immediate exit is advisable.<br><br>A slim, catlike man may well rebound before a hasty exit can be made.<br><br>Obstructing the path of a violent man to his firearm will nearly always result in another encroachment.<br><br>Kicking him in the foreneck, even barefoot, will temporarily occlude his windpipe.<br><br>The alpha beauty of a violent man will know where his firearm is kept, and how to use it.<br><br>A woman holding a gun and a baby no longer qualifies as a beauty.<br><br>No beauty is really a beauty.<br><br>Disabling a gun holder is likely to hurt the baby she is holding, too.<br><br>When self-preservation requires that you harm the innocent, we can provide no more than guidelines.<br><br>As Americans, we value human rights above all else and cannot sanction their violation.<br><br>When someone threatens *our* human rights, however, a wider leeway becomes necessary.<br><br>Follow your instincts while bearing in mind that we must, and will, hew to our principles.<br><br>A woman holding a thrashing baby in one arm may have trouble aiming a firearm with the other.<br><br>Bullets do actually whistle in an enclosed space.<br><br>If a person has shot at you and missed, incapacitate her before she can fire again.<br><br>We

have been fired in a powerful man’s home, you have minutes, if not seconds, before the arrival of security.<br><br>Your physical person is our Black Box; without it, we have no record of what has happened on your mission.<br><br>It is imperative that you remove yourself from enemy possession.<br><br>When you find yourself cornered and outnumbered, you may unleash, as a last resort, your Primal Roar.<br><br>The Primal Roar is the human equivalent of an explosion, a sound that combines screaming, shrieking, and howling.<br><br>The Roar must be accompanied by facial contortions and frenetic body movement, suggesting a feral, unhinged state.<br><br>The Primal Roar must transform you from a beauty into a monster.<br><br>The goal is to horrify your opponent, the way trusted figures, turned evil, are horrifying in movies and in nightmares.<br><br>Deploy your camera flash repeatedly while Roaring.<br><br>When approached by a howling, spasmodic, flashing monster, most women holding newborns will step aside.<br><br>Discontinue Roaring the instant you’re free from immediate danger.<br><br>Those stampeding to the aid of a powerful man will barely notice a dishevelled beauty they pass in a hallway.<br><br>If you’re lucky, this will buy you time to flee his house.<br><br>Resume your beauty role while running: smooth your hair and cover your bleeding wound with the sundress scrunched in your pocket.<br><br>The fact that you can’t hear alarms doesn’t mean you haven’t set them off.<br><br>## 39<br>After violence in a closed room, cool night air will have a clarifying effect.<br><br>Get to the bottom of a hill any way you can, including sliding and rolling.<br><br>In residences of the violent rich, there will be at least one guard at each port of egress.<br><br>In deep night, if you are extremely lucky (and quiet), that guard will be asleep.<br><br>Assume, as well as you can, the air of a beauty larkishly gambolling.<br><br>If running barefoot onto a dock transports you back to your childhood, pain may be making you hallucinate.<br><br>Lying with girlfriends on a still-warm dock in upstate New York, watching shooting stars, is a sensation you remember after many years.<br><br>Hindsight creates the illusion that your life has led you inevitably to the present moment.<br><br>It’s easier to believe in a foregone conclusion than to accept that our lives are governed by chance.<br><br>Showing up for a robotics course by accident, because of a classroom mixup, is chance.<br><br>Finding an empty seat beside a boy with very dark skin and beautiful hands is chance.<br><br>When someone has become essential to you, you will marvel that you could have lain on a warm dock and not have known him yet.<br><br>Expect reimmersion in your old life to be difficult.<br><br>Experience leaves a mark, regardless of the reasons and principles behind it.<br><br>What our citizen agents most often require is simply for time to pass.<br><br>Our counsellors are available around the clock for the first two weeks of your reimmersion and during business hours thereafter.<br><br>We ask that you allow our Therapeutic Agents, rather than those in the general population, to address your needs.<br><br>Secrecy is the basis of what we do, and we require your extreme discretion.<br><br>## 40<br>Even preternatural swimming strength cannot propel you across a blue-black sea.<br><br>Staring with yearning ferocity from the end of a dock cannot propel you across a blue-black sea.<br><br>When your body has been granted exceptional powers, it is jarring to encounter a gulf between your desires and your abilities.<br><br>For millennia, engineers have empowered human beings to accomplish mythical feats.<br><br>Your husband is an engineer.<br><br>Children raised among wild animals learn to detect irregular movements in their landscape.<br><br>That particular awareness, coupled with scientific genius, has made your husband a national-security hero.<br><br>Intimacy with another human can allow you to scrutinize your surroundings as he would.<br><br>Along a rocky, moonlit shore, the irregular movement is the one that is lurching in time with the water beneath an overhang of brush.<br><br>A speedboat has most likely been hidden by your new host as a means of emergency escape.<br><br>The key will be inside it.<br><br>## 41<br>Slither between branches and board the boat; untie it and lower its motor into the water.<br><br>Be grateful for the lakes in upstate New York where you learned to pilot motorboats.<br><br>Fluff up your hair with your functional arm and essay a wide, carefree smile.<br><br>A smile is like a shield; it freezes your face into a mask of muscle that you can hide behind.<br><br>A smile is like a door that is both open and closed.<br><br>Turn the key and gun the motor once before aiming into the blue-black sea and jamming the accelerator.<br><br>Wave and giggle loudly at the stunned, sleepy guard.<br><br>Steer in a zigzag motion until you are out of gunshot range.<br><br>## 42<br>The exultation of escape will be followed almost immediately by a crushing onslaught of pain.<br><br>The house, its occupants, even the gunshots will seem like phantoms beside this clanging immediacy.<br><br>If the pain makes thought impossible, concentrate solely on navigation.<br><br>Only in specific Geographic Hotspots can we intervene.<br><br>While navigating toward a Hotspot, indicate an emergency by pressing the button behind your knee for sixty continuous seconds.<br><br>You must remain conscious.<br><br>If it helps, imagine yourself in the arms of your husband.<br><br>If it helps, imagine yourself in your apartment, where his grandfather’s hunting knife is displayed inside a Plexiglas box.<br><br>If it helps, imagine harvesting the small tomatoes you grow on your fire escape in summer.<br><br>If it helps, imagine that the contents of the Data Surge will help thwart an attack in which thousands of American lives would have been lost.<br><br>Even without enhancements, you can pilot a boat in a semi-conscious state.<br><br>Human beings are superhuman.<br><br>Let the moon and the stars direct you.<br><br>## 43<br>When you reach the approximate location of a Hotspot, cut the engine.<br><br>You will be in total darkness, in total silence.<br><br>If you wish, you may lie down at the bottom of the boat.<br><br>The fact that you feel like you’re dying doesn’t mean that you will die.<br><br>Remember that, should you die, your body will yield a crucial trove of information.<br><br>Remember that, should you die, your Field Instructions will provide a record of your mission and lessons for those who follow.<br><br>Remember that, should you die, you will have triumphed merely by delivering your physical person into our hands.<br><br>The boat’s movement on the sea will remind you of a cradle.<br><br>You’ll recall your mother rocking you in her arms when you were a baby.<br><br>You’ll recall that she has always loved you fiercely and entirely.<br><br>You’ll discover that you have forgiven her.<br><br>You’ll understand that she concealed your paternity out of faith that her own inexhaustible love would be enough.<br><br>The wish to tell your mother that you forgive her is yet another reason you must make it home alive.<br><br>You will not be able to wait, but you will have to wait.<br><br>We can’t tell you in advance what direction relief will come from.<br><br>We can only reassure you that we have never yet failed to recover a citizen agent, dead or alive, who managed to reach a Hotspot.<br><br>## 44<br>Hotspots are not hot.<br><br>Even a warm night turns frigid at the bottom of a wet boat.<br><br>The stars are always there, scattered and blinking.<br><br>Looking up at the sky from below can feel like floating, suspended, and looking down.<br><br>The universe will seem to hang beneath you in its milky glittering mystery.<br><br>Only when you notice a woman like yourself, crumpled and bleeding at the bottom of a boat, will you realize what has happened.<br><br>You’ve deployed the Dissociation Technique without meaning to.<br><br>There is no harm in this.<br><br>Released from pain, you can waft free in the night sky.<br><br>Released from pain, you can enact the fantasy of flying that you nurtured as a child.<br><br>Keep your body in view at all times; if your mind loses track of your body, it may be hard—even impossible—to reunite the two.<br><br>As you waft free in the night sky, you may notice a steady rhythmic churning in the gusting wind.<br><br>Helicopter noise is inherently menacing.<br><br>A helicopter without lights is like a mixture of bat, bird, and monstrous insect.<br><br>Resist the urge to flee this apparition; it has come to save you.<br><br>## 45<br>Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to be racked, once again, by physical pain.<br><br>Know that in returning to your body you are consenting to undertake a jarring reimmersion into an altered life.<br><br>Some citizen agents have chosen not to return.<br><br>They have left their bodies behind, and now they shimmer sublimely in the heavens.<br><br>In the new heroism, the goal is to transcend individual life, with its petty pains and loves, in favor of the dazzling collective.<br><br>You may picture the pulsing stars as the heroic spirits of former agent beauties.<br><br>You may imagine Heaven as a vast screen crowded with their dots of light.<br><br>## 46<br>If you wish to return to your body, it is essential that you reach it before the helicopter does.<br><br>If it helps, count backward.<br><br>By eight, you should be close enough to see your bare and dirty feet.<br><br>By five, you should be close enough to see the bloody dress wrapped around your shoulder.<br><br>By three, you should be close enough to see the dimples you were praised for as a child.<br><br>By two, you should hear the shallow bleating of your breath.<br><br>## 47<br>Having returned to your body, witness the chopper’s slow, throbbing descent.<br><br>It may appear to be the instrument of a purely mechanical realm.<br><br>It may look as if it had come to wipe you out.<br><br>It may be hard to believe that there are human beings inside it.<br><br>You won’t know for sure until you see them crouching above you, their faces taut with hope, ready to jump.&nbsp;♦<br><br>
